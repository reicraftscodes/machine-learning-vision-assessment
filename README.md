# Machine learning for language and vision
This section consists of collective workbook I did from one of ML & Vision model, where all students are required to submit weekly assignments. 

The main project for MLV was the Week 6 - Daily Dialogue notebook to develop an ML solution for this NLP problem, and also the Week 5 - Essay on Generative AI ethical issue.
