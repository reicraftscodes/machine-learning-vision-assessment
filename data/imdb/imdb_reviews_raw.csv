0,16-tt0094074,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094074/,So bad I remember...,"I will not succumb to the temptation of reminding everyone once again how terrible the special effects are and how many times one can see the supporting wires. Instead I will focus on the few good aspects of the movie. Chris Reeve is once again great in being superman and Gene Hackman is an absolute joy to watch as the menacing Luthor with only one thing on his mind ""Destroy superman"". The references to the first two movies e.g.flying sequence with Lois Lane and the well known score remind us of why they were so successful.  I agree with the nonsensical space sequence but not so much with superman moving the moon. It's a comic book movie after all and in the first film he managed to get the earth out of orbit! You know the whole idea of a man flying and being invincible is quite impossible so why don't you pick on that too? In superman's world anything can happen.  However what is painful for me personally is Warner Bros not being bothered to refurbish superman 4 just like Lucas did with the original star wars trilogy(added better sound, new scenes e.g. Hayden Christensen at the end of the return of the Jedi). They could use modern technology and hide the visible wires and improve the flying sequences. I am sure it won't be expensive. Plus why not even restore the 45 minutes of deleted footage? Dick Donner did so in the first film and also later this year a new restored cut of superman 2 is coming out with all the deleted Donner footage. Why not patch up a low budget effort and restore superman's former glory?  For the performances of Reeve, Hackman and the rest of the common superman characters I chose to give this film 5 out of 10 and I hope that one day we will see it patched up.",
1,3-tt0094074,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094074/,The Last Nail in the Superman Coffin.,"SUPERMAN IV: THE QUEST FOR PEACE pits the Man of Steel against Nuclear Man, Lex Luther's newest creation while ridding the world of nuclear weapons. This is easily the worst of the SUPERMAN movies, and it was doomed to fail right from the start.  Cut from its original 134-minute version, it is full of plot holes resulting in a movie with some scenes that just don't make any sense, but even with the extra 45 minutes intact, the movie still wouldn't work because the special effects are cheap and ridiculous, and it shows. Unless you are a diehard fan of the Superman genre, this movie should be avoided.  1 out of 5",
2,8-tt0059466,Monsters Crash the Pajama Party,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059466/,Buy the DVD,"Monsters Crash the Pajama Party (1965)   1/2 (out of 4)   Long before audience members started acting out The Rocky Horror Picture Show, there were the famous ""Spook Shows"". With these events theaters would show some sort of low-budget horror movie and do a William Castle-like event of having monsters from the screen walking around in the theater scaring those watching the movie. This film has five sorority girls spending the night in a haunted house where an evil doctor and his gorilla assistant are doing nasty experiments. As far as the film goes it's incredibly poorly made, features horrid acting and the so called story is very weak but I guess the events in the movie would make for an interesting spook show. Since I only have the film itself to review then it's not really fair to guess what the spook show crowd would have done but even at thirty-minutes this particular show is hard to get through. I think what really hurts the film is how it starts. There aren't any opening credits and instead we just have a narrator telling us who directed, stars and wrote the film. Okay but we also have the gorilla acting out all the jobs, which is okay I guess but this sequence runs on and on to the point where it just gets boring. The only time I laughed during the film is one sequence where a werewolf jumps out to scare the girls but his pants fall down instead.",
3,4-tt0059466,Monsters Crash the Pajama Party,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059466/,"Horrible movie, but great DVD!","Very odd and very short color film that tries as a horror comedy.  There are no opening credits.  The film opens with a man wearing a lab coat with ""Mad Doctor"" on his coat pocket.  He talks to the audience for a while and then we get an announcer read to us who is in the movie, who made it, who edited it, etc while we see a man in a gorilla suit in different settings.  Looks like an amateur film.  Plot concerns a group of sorority pledges who have to spend the night in a haunted house.  The house has a mad doctor, a gorilla, a hunchback, an oriental woman, and a werewolf in the basement.  Whole thing is done in fun with gorilla frequently holding up signs with one word phrases.",
4,10-tt0112462,Batman Forever,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112462/,Better than most people remember.,"While the Batman franchise has been much maligned in recent years due to the disappointing performance of the last live-action film, Forever was second in quality only to the first Bat-film. It added color back into a Gotham that had gotten way too claustrophobic, and brought the tone back to something resembling the comics. Jim Carrey is a scene-stealer and dead on as The Riddler, and Val Kilmer is the perfect Bruce Wayne and Batman. Tommy Lee Jones does a great turn as Two-Face, unfortunately he isn't given enough to do and therefore comes across too cartoony, minus the angst of the character in the comics. One other big complaint is the new score - gone are Danny Elfman's orchestrations.  Elliot Goldenthal's music would have been fine if not for his predecessor. Most people tend to lump this one in the 'lousy' section, it seems, but it was one of the biggest movies of '95 and a very faithful adaption overall. Now if they'd only release the director's cut",
5,9-tt0112462,Batman Forever,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112462/,Why did they omitted the dark n dystopian look. Jim Carrey did the same overacting what he did in Mask.,"I first saw this with a bunch of school pals in Sterling theatre (South Bombay) in the year 1995. Revisited it recently with my 10 year old nephew.  After having enjoyed both the Keaton's Batman movies on vhs in the late 90s, i was looking forward for the theatrical experience.  While Keaton's movies were dark with gothic style n a dystopian atmosphere, especially Batman Returns was far ahead of its time with a scary villain. Even my 10 year old nephew found the Penguin villain far better n scary than the 2022 version.  Batman Forever ruined the experience with unnecessary comedic elements n lottuva overacting by Jim Carey who did the same stuff what he did in previous year's The Mask.  We have Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon.  He played Gordon in the 1989 film Batman and its three sequels. He is one of only two actors to appear in the four Batman films from 1989 to 1997; the other is Michael Gough as Alfred Pennyworth.  In one scene Robin is caught by Two Face while Batman is engaged with The Riddler n then suddenly without any explanation, Robin is shown trapped by The Riddler.",
6,15-tt0118688,Batman & Robin,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118688/,How to make the worst movie EVER! In 10 easy steps.,"How did the Batman series begin so well and come to this? OK, none of the films are masterpieces, but this one is insulting. Anyone who paid to see it should join a class action to recover damages against the filmmakers.  Lousy acting from great actors. And some of the worst -- perhaps the worst -- set design ever. The plot is a grab bag, literally. A little of this, a little of that. No particular rationale behind any of it. I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall as the cast watched the film. Every single one must have thought, ""It can't get any worse than this.""  The most amazing thing of all: Director Joel Schumacher has actually been entrusted with directing jobs after this.",
7,1-tt0118688,Batman & Robin,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118688/,"What almost killed the Batman franchise? ""The Ice Age!""","Strangely enough, that's one ice-related pun that Mr.Freeze doesn't use in this film. Though it does adequately describe the movie. What was I thinking, watching Batman & Robin for a third time? Even worse, what was I doing actually starting to enjoy it?  Yes, there's something endearingly awful about a film that fails on almost every technical level. But it wasn't always so. The first two films in the franchise, anchored by the strong, and much undervalued lead of Michael Keaton, were enjoyable pop-art excursions by Tim Burton. The first, still by far the best, allowed Jack Nicholson to ham it up amongst retro stylings and the music of Prince. The second, Batman Returns, was a less successful effort to homage German expressionist cinema, the darkest of the four films, and struggled slightly under the weight of three villains.  The lesson wasn't learnt, and the usage of multiple baddies has been a fixed staple ever since. With the third, Batman Forever, the flat acting of new bat Val Kilmer was coupled with Joel Schumacher's garish direction and Chris O'Donnell's irritating Robin. Akiva Goldsman was now the writer, and any sense of depth had given way to trite puns and disjointed set pieces.  And so it was that everything that was symptomatically flawed with the series was expanded upon and magnified for the fourth, and by far the weakest, instalment. George Clooney has accepted a lot of the blame for this film, a humble admission but unfair. While he's clearly miscast as both Batman and Bruce Wayne, he doesn't give a bad performance per se. Rather, it's his back up that lets the side down. Uma Thurman (am I the only one who doesn't think she's that good-looking?) has a great time overdoing it as Poison Ivy, but she's joined by Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze. Schwarz, not exactly known for his acting skill, is unrecognisable under his costume, so what's the point? He gets to call Batman ""Batunbuuurg"", refers to Robin as ""Buuurd Bouy"" and only has 100 lines in total. The fact that 26% of these lines are lame puns on the word ""ice"" that even a two-year-old would struggle to find funny is even more deplorable. And when you hear Freeze tell Batman ""Yew arr not zending mee too da cooola"" the urge to use the video's ""stop"" button is almost insurmountable.  Bane makes up the trio, a monosyllabic muscleman in a gimp mask. A completely unnecessary addition, he offers nothing to the plot and goes largely forgotten. The introduction of wonky-mouthed Alicia Silverstone as a fatuous Batgirl character is also grating. And why doesn't her costume come fitted with Batnipples like the rest?  Tiny traces of amusement can be gleaned from Ivy's dialogue, with her urges that her ""garden needs tending"" adding some form of adult tone to the humour. However, it's unrelenting innuendo - ""I'll help you grab your rocks"" - does start to wear thin very quickly. I did smile at Batman's cashcard: ""I never leave the cave without it""; and it's also nice to see some small references from other films. Even if it is just a glimpse of the Riddler's costume from Forever, some guards paraphrasing Cobra or some street bystanders dressed as Clockwork Orange Droogs. In fact, the idea of a Batman film as completely OTT comedy send-up may have worked, were the rest of the humour more sophisticated. ""It's the hockey team from Hell""; ""So this is where you hang out""; ""I'll cancel the pizza""; oh, how lame and functional the dialogue is!  The film wraps up with a rather pathetic plot contrivance, and George having to dish out bland platitudes. ""Not all heroes wear masks""; ""to give life... that's true power"". Oh, it really is abominably bad. Batman & Robin exists as a classic example of the Hollywood system folding in under its own weight. However, the universal slating this one got neglects one factor: while the least successful, it still made over $230,000,000 at the box office. I wonder how many people would be satisfied with ""failures"" like that?",
8,18-tt0074148,Ape,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074148/,Yeah a Giant ape,"This film begins with an obvious toy boat being destroyed by a guy in a cheap gorilla suit--the sort you'd rent for just a few dollars at a costume shop. Then, he proceeds to destroy a bunch of buildings that look even cheaper and sillier than those found in the Japanese giant monster films from Toho Studios! Most of the time, he moves about in super-slow motion and does a whole lot of nothing. And, as he does not much at all, you hear circus-like music. This time, however, the movie is a bit different, as the extras are all Korean AND their command of English is amazingly bad--so bad that it's rather funny to hear some of them stumble over even the simplest words.  Sadly, however, as the movie progresses, you learn that the cheap sets and guy in the gorilla suit and Koreans who can't speak English are the BEST aspects of the film!! That's because the acting is abysmal, the editing was done by a chimp, many scenes featuring screaming Korean peasants went on too long, the music highly inappropriate as well as annoying and the dialog is among the worst I've ever heard. Believe me, Ed Wood couldn't have made a gorilla film any worse than this (including his own BRIDE AND THE MONSTER).  There are unnecessary subplots involving a rather bland-looking actress and her boyfriend as well as a Colonel who is a total idiot (and needs a good haircut to even remotely look military) and curses CONSTANTLY--possibly more than any character in the 1970s. Aside from these stupid subplots, the rest of the film is essentially KING KONG but set in a Korea that is chock-full of crappy sets.  Overall, there really is nothing to recommend this film--unless you really need to see a guy in a gorilla suit flipping off the army (I kid you not--this REALLY happened in the movie). It's so bad, that it's a film almost exclusively for bad movie fans. It's also a great film for Jeff Bridges, Jessica Lange or Dino De Laurentiis to watch so that they can see that by comparison, the poor 1976 KING KONG film is like a Merchant-Ivory production! However, I do NOT recommend that Kim Jong-Il see the film--he might be tempted to nuke South Korea, since they were responsible for this atrocity of a movie!",
9,0-tt0074148,Ape,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074148/,Hilarious Korean Monster Film,"This is a great bad movie and many of the scenes are hilarious. If you'd enjoy watching a 60-sec slow-motion scene where a guy in a gorilla costume wrestles an obviously dead shark, thrashing it around and pretending to be in the throes of death, look no further. This whole movie is full of great scenes like that, and if it weren't for an overly drawn out love story subplot, ""A.P.E."" would be a 5-star unintentional comedy. You get a little bit of everything in this South Korean flick: ""Godzilla""-style miniature sets, toy model animals and people, remote control helicopters, firework explosions, and of course, a guy in a gorilla suit. The plot is not important, really, and the film gets right down to brass tacks after about 2-min of backstory. Just know that there is a 35-ft tall ape, and he is going to rampage Korea. Throw in an American actress (Joanna Kerns, of ""Growing Pains"" fame), her reporter boyfriend, and a pair of Army officers bent on killing the beast, and you have ""A.P.E."" The direction and editing are sometimes stunningly inept, resulting in several great ""WTF moments,"" including my favorite when a character is hanging off the outside door of a moving jeep, for seemingly no reason. Anyhow, I could go on forever with this one. As far as bad movies go, ""A.P.E."" is a definite keeper. You are going to get laughs out of this one.",
10,11-tt1316037,Birdemic: Shock and Terror,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1316037/,i am a bird,"I don't know where to begin this review. It is a film that completely fails at every step of the movie making process. From directing, to acting, to writing, to camera operation, to scene structure, to pacing, to visual effects, to sound editing... The list goes on. I watched birdemic thinking it was a 'deliberately bad so it's funny' kinda movie. It's not. You can see the films director James Nguyan takes himself completely seriously with the global warming message jammed down our throats. I spent the majority of the hour and thirty minute run time laughing in disbelief that this movie exists. It is a film you have to watch, if only to know how to gauge a bad movie in the future. I was just wondering what fundamental error they were going to make next. Overall birdemic is a fascinating piece of work simply because it is truly awful cinema. So terrible that it's unintentionally hilarious. I would absolutely classify it as a must watch.",
11,6-tt1316037,Birdemic: Shock and Terror,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1316037/,Unbearable,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I do not mean that it is a good movie, as it is one of the worst movies ever made. However, the magnitude of this movie's failure makes it a truly original experience. Birdemic Shock and Terror puts your mind in a place between awe and crying from laughter. No other movie, even ones with comparable ratings , can compare to this movie. This movie pulls off awful in such a way that blows your mind. After you watch this movie, you will be left speechless for almost a 1/2 hour just trying to comprehend what you just watched. It is truly a one-of-a-kind experience that I feel everyone should have.",
12,13-tt0045826,Glen or Glenda,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045826/,Don't let the low rating fool you - this is a must see!,"1953's ""Glen or Glenda"" can only be regarded as the autobiographical work of an auteur, in this case Edward D. Wood Jr., whose initial notoriety as a purveyor of bad cinema has made him something more than 'worst director of all time' in that his enjoyment of the filmmaking process creates a genuinely likable figure, unlike those (like Jerry Warren) out to make a fast buck without undue effort (Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert made this clear in their praise of Tim Burton's 1994 biopic). Producer George Weiss sought to capitalize on the recent sex change of Christine Jorgensen, her published account in February 1953 sounding like exploitation gold, but with Ed Wood on board Weiss got more than he bargained for and less of what he desired on screen. He got a man who would work for peanuts, as well as play the lead performance complete in full female regalia (especially the angora sweaters), but this impassioned plea for tolerance from a disbelieving public came up short in most every way, including running time. What most likely took place was the addition of professional names to guarantee marquee value and acceptable feature length padding, Lyle Talbot a fairly busy character player who had no qualms about working in Poverty Row productions, cast as an inspector examining the suicide of cross dressing Glen (Wood, using the acting pseudonym 'Daniel Davis'), keeping his hidden side Glenda a secret from fiancee Barbara (Dolores Fuller). Perhaps more to Ed Wood's liking is top billed Bela Lugosi as the unnamed 'Scientist' who comments on events periodically, more puppet master than mad scientist, particularly with his frequent announcement: ""pull the string!"" The actor leaves his comfortable chair only once to produce a smoking beaker of liquid, otherwise it's one incredible line after another delivered in typical Lugosi style, slowly drawing out the syllables for a still entertaining performance under very limited circumstances (less than 9 minutes screen time). The first half keeps the focus on Wood, but by the latter stages more daring footage is introduced by the producer of women lounging, engaged in bondage, or even enjoying simulated sex (fully clothed of course), before the introduction of a second character who undergoes the whole Jorgensen treatment to transition from man to woman. Falling on hard times in the late 40s, one would think that reprising the role of Count Dracula in a huge success like ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein"" would increase Bela's opportunities for further work, but shortsighted Hollywood only called upon him twice more while Ed Wood managed at least three to close out his final decade. Fortunately he's not required to leave the confines of a miniscule set, in a picture that may be worse yet no less frenzied than ""Bride of the Monster"" or ""Plan 9 from Outer Space,"" a bold statement to make for a first feature attempt, just the beginning for Ed Wood's imagination to run wild and even using his own father as the horned devil!",
13,14-tt0045826,Glen or Glenda,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045826/,"Way ahead of it's time, and was also used as a teaching tool!","Sitting in a big wing chair with a huge book in his lap, the one and only Bela Lugosi looks into the camera and, in a dreadful vocal delivery that sounds as if he were mocking a reading of Shakespeare, intones sloooow-ly: ""Man's constant groping of things unknown, drawing from the endless reaches of time, brings to light many startling things; (snicker); startling?, because they seem new (Lugosi's eyes now bulging, with raised eyebrows, and mouth sneering, he continues) but most are not new, the signs of the ages"" (cue a visual of lightening, accompanied by the sound of thunder which then continues to rumble for an astonishing 86 seconds).  And so begins what is arguably the worst film ever made. This ""movie"" almost defies description. Told in semi-docudrama style with an unseen narrator explaining the plot ... such as it is ... the story revolves around the vicissitudes of a man named Glen (Ed Wood, Jr.) who cross-dresses; hence the reference to Glenda. The film has no real structure. Instead, it consists mostly of a random assortment of vignettes that may ... or may not ... relate to Glen or to the cross-dressing motif. One long sequence consists of some unknown woman wriggling on a sofa, followed by a man whipping a woman in what we would today refer to as S&M.  Then, at odd moments Bela reappears, for no apparent reason, and babbles more inane dialogue, like: ""When he's wrong because he does right, and when he's right because he does wrong; pull the string, dance to that."" Huh?  About twenty percent of the film's visuals consist of stock footage, accompanied by a VO that relates to the story motif but not the visuals. Hence, we see stock footage of: bustling city streets, freeway traffic, a thunderous herd of buffalo, and a playground full of kids. But it gets worse. In a film about cross-dressing, we have 58 consecutive seconds of stock footage of a foundry furnace making hot steel, and 84 consecutive seconds of battle scenes from WWII.  Even the simplest items are botched. In one scene we see a newspaper headline that reads ""Man Nabbed Dressed as Girl"". Underneath the headline, which has clearly been glued or pasted on, the article is about ... taxes. In one of my favorite scenes, an off-screen woman spouts out: ""airplanes, why it's against the creator's will"", in a voice that sounds like she's just inhaled helium.  Except for the performance of Lyle Talbot, the acting is uniformly horrendous. Production design is cheap looking and drab; (but you gotta love that tacky wallpaper). The editing is sloppy. Most of the background music is suitable only for 1950 style elevators. The B&W cinematography has way too much contrast. And the costumes look like something that came from a thrift store.  This film is so bad it makes ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" look like ""Citizen Kane"", by comparison. I just don't know how one could make a film any worse than Ed Wood's ""Glen Or Glenda"". But thankfully, it's got Bela Lugosi in it. Every time he opened his mouth, and gazed into the camera with those big, bulging eyes, I about fell on the floor laughing.",
14,2-tt1910621,Space Thunder Kids,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1910621/,Impossibly Bad,"Okay, I had to write something here because the only other reviews here gave it 1/10 and honestly, I didn't think it was THAT bad. It's not exactly good, but it's really not that bad.  The script and dialogue are terrible and all over the place, but it's so bad that it's actually kind of funny if you don't take it too seriously. I actually liked a lot of the animation. I've seen much worse. It's better than the animation in Speed Racer. Maybe that's not saying much, but you could tell that in parts of this, some serious work was put into it.  This thing has a little bit of everything, ripping off everything from Voltron to Tron to Dracula and so much more I lost count. It was fun to keep watching and see what they were going to rip off next, whether it made any sense to the story or not. I was laughing my ass off!  If you've got an hour or so to kill, you could do worse.
5/10 is probably too generous, but 1/10 is too harsh, in my opinion.",
15,0-tt1910621,Space Thunder Kids,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1910621/,"Dreadful animated movie, but also one to revel in its awfulness","I love animation/anime, and have done since a very early age. Space Thunder Kids is not the worst animated movie I've seen, but it is laughably bad and you, like I sort of did, might find some entertainment value in its awfulness.  The animation has a dull and unfinished quality to it. The backgrounds are often static, with the galactic backgrounds not doing anything for me, and the colours are flat. The character designs fare worse, they are stiff and forced, and the dubbing is rarely in sync with the lip movements. Actually, I think the lip movements were nearly always ahead of the speaking. Also in the beginning alone, there are objects that float around aimlessly and when they are hit with laser beams they pop in very slow motion, more reminiscent of balloons that take a long time to pop.  The music when it appears wasn't so bad in its orchestration at the time, it's just that afterwards it was very forgettable and there are times in the movie where you felt it could have had less music or that a scene didn't need any music. The characters I was mostly indifferent to, the Dark Emperor was intriguing by name but you don't know much about him while the lead characters are annoying. The voice acting/dubbing is very poor and sloppy, with the actors sounding as though they are not putting any effort in.  The story is another major problem. It is a very unoriginal and thin one. I liked the idea somewhat, don't get me wrong, but that idea was completely abandoned halfway through. Not only that, the film feels as though it has three different beginnings, three beginnings that feel disjointed and don't do much to move the story forward or set the tone of the story. The film is only a little over 80 minutes, but because the pace is so sluggish in places it feels longer. And I mustn't forget the writing, it is dreadfully cheesy. However, I found it impossible not to be amused, not because the dialogue was hilarious or anything but because the lines and delivery of them were so bad.  In conclusion, dreadful but had some novelty value. 1/10 Bethany Cox",
16,23-tt0103923,Captain America,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103923/,"""Captain America"" gets way more flack for being cheesy and low budget than it deserves","Before 1998's ""Blade,"" Marvel Comics couldn't seem to catch a break when it came to movie versions of their different properties. In the wake of ""Iron Man 3"" and ""The Avengers,"" I know that's very hard to believe. There was a serial for Captain America released in 1944 through Republic Pictures. George Lucas executive produced a live-action adaptation of ""Howard the Duck"" in 1986.  The next few years up to Wesley Snipes' take on the legendary vampire slayer were plagued with low-budget versions of the comic book publisher's characters. Dolph Lundgren's ""The Punisher"" couldn't even muster a theatrical release in the U.S. Roger Corman's ""The Fantastic Four"" never officially saw the light of day anywhere, although bootleg copies float around.  21st Century Film Corporation released ""Captain America"" straight to video in the middle of those two disasters. For many years, the movie was hard to get a hold of and only released on VHS. Shout! Factory released it on DVD and made it widely available to those who sought it out for so many years as a sort of Nerd Holy Grail.  Several years after being caught by Red Skull and left for dead, Steve Rogers is found frozen in the ice and thawed out. He discovers Red Skull received plastic surgery to hide his true identity and is heading up a group of world leaders set on kidnapping the President of the United States for their own diabolical ambitions.  Is ""Captain America"" filled with cheese? If you judge it from a modern standpoint, of course it is. If you look at it as being a piece of World War II propaganda filmed in the 1940s, you'll find it totally hits its mark. That's the standpoint I choose to view it from.  My only real issue is that we only get about 5 minutes of face time from the real Red Skull. The rest of the film features actor Scott Paulin in flesh-colored make-up topped with scar lines. It's a real letdown for fans of the Red Skull who wanted to see the character the way he looks in the comic books.  I still think that ""Captain America"" gets way more flack for being cheesy and low budget than it deserves. Is it on the same quality level as ""Captain America: The First Avenger?"" No way! However, it has an inviting and personal flavor to it that still works 23 years later. Real comic book fans will find value in this adaption and appreciate it for what it is.",
17,6-tt0103923,Captain America,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103923/,This 1990 version of Captain America can be pretty entertaining despite some noticeable flaws,"Okay, so after watching the Republic serial from 1944 in which Captain America's alter ego was Grant Gardner, district attorney, and then two TV movie versions starring Reb Brown as Steve Rogers, occasional painter, I finally watched this 1990 version from Menahem Golan's 21st Century Film Corporation starring Matt Salinger as the super soldier from World War II that gets frozen for several decades before being thawed out. I liked the beginning where we find out about both his and The Red Skull's (Scott Paulin) early lives and there was a quite entertaining fight between them during the WWII sequence though it would have been nice to know what dastardly thing the Skull did that lead to that battle. But then we're abruptly taken to the present day to when Cap finds himself waking up to and it takes a little time to once again find some momentum. That said, having Ronny Cox and Ned Beatty as a couple of old pals now serving as president and reporter, respectively, was a nice treat for anyone who remembers them from Deliverance not to mention Beatty for his previous superhero encounter in the first two Christopher Reeve Superman movies. And how awesome it was to finally see the CA costume done right this time with both the wings on the cowl and the shield just the right size and color. Even more so was all the hot women that abounded though I have to wonder how any of them could realistically be daughters of the disfigured Red Skull! So in summation, this filmed version of Captain America may be a little on the underwhelming side concerning story logic but the action for the most part makes it worth it for at least one viewing though I probably wouldn't mind watching it again. Can't wait for Chris Evans in Captain America: The First Avenger later this summer.",
18,7-tt0109770,The Fantastic Four,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109770/,Truly bewildering and unintentionally funny,"There's so, so very much going on here. The cast's contributions are mostly characterized by overacting that's brazen if not daring. It's hard to pinpoint just one or two examples because there are so many, but the sheer exuberance Jay Underwood embraces as Johnny Storm is astonishing - and more wild than this is Michael Bailey Smith's delivery of a line as Ben Grimm invites the Storms into space. Transitions and editing at large are often downright zany. The special effects are actually pretty decent, provided that you accept they're somewhere between twenty and thirty years out of date for 1994. To that point, the production values at large are peculiar: sure enough, this has the look and feel of any picture Roger Corman may have made in the 50s or 60s, yet this came along a good few decades after the filmmaker first rose to prominence. And we're just getting started, because in every regard there were choices made in making 'The Fantastic Four' that represent a great host of myriad oddities and contradictions. At times it's like it wanted to embrace the cartoonish revelry of, say, Adam West's Batman, or Joel Schumacher's 'Batman and Robin,' but lacked the resources to do so.  There are elements of the plot that just aren't explained, like what qualifications Sue and Johnny could possibly have to join Reed and Ben on their pivotal journey. While the powers of the Storms are very well established in cultural history, in this movie we see how, for both, a couple of their abilities are never touched upon at all until they suddenly become relevant to the climax. No explanation is forthcoming for how Doom goes from a prideful college student to an archvillain who is for some reason addressed as Prince (even passing knowledge of comics lore tells us; this feature does not). Speaking of the writing, the dialogue is excruciatingly ham-handed at some times, such as the repetition of The Thing's trademark line. More than this, the first verbal iteration of the group's name that compelled me to yell at the screen. Why, to that point, the way the superhero team comes together (with uniforms, out of nowhere), and the resources they inexplicably have at their disposal, are altogether mind-blowing. Please note, too, how The Thing's pants change throughout the plot. Both of two romantic aspects in the narrative are weirdly contrived, inventions of pure movie magic, and in a broad sense some of the decisions that characters make are dubious to say the least.  Dr. Doom's costume is surprisingly faithful to the comics; on the other hand, The Thing looks a lot like Harry from 'Harry and the Hendersons,' only covered with rock instead of fur. An oft-repeated theme in the score, portending tenderness, family, and love, borrows HEAVILY from James Horner's score for 1991 family adventure favorite 'The Rocketeer.' Vocal effects employed to alter Joseph Culp's voice as Dr. Doom, and especially Carl Ciarfalio's voice as The Thing, are unnecessary and distracting, and in and of themselves detract from the viewing experience. I do earnestly respect the work put into the production design and art direction - details from costume design, and hair and makeup work, to set design, and props - though the wide range from ""spartan and minimal"" to ""all-in and extravagant"" is frankly incredible. And so on, and so on.  Yet what's really amazing about 'The Fantastic Four' - complete, finished, but officially unreleased - is that despite its reputation, it's not nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be. It's a mess, a hodgepodge, a patchwork of curiosities; it's low-budget, bursting with perplexing ideas and inclusions, and outright cringe-worthy in no few parts. For all this, however: it only wanted to have fun. And it is. Mind you, the fact that this rendition of Marvel's oldest superhero saga is as entertaining as it is, despite its flaws and shortcomings, is in no small part because it is bewildering, and therefore unintentionally funny. I cannot emphasize enough what a delightfully strange experience it is, and one that's best enjoyed with friends, where the joy can be shared. I don't wish to spoil the surprise, but that joy includes what are among the funniest 10 seconds of film I've ever seen, a little after the 1 hour 25 minute marker, as outrageously obsolete visual effects collide with a highly questionable character decision and an astounding choice of writing or direction.  Once more: there's so, so very much going on here. I can understand why this is so poorly regarded, and it's not undeserved. However, the flip-side of all the bizarrerie is that for those who are sincerely receptive to all the wide possibilities cinema has to offer, the assemblage of all the varied, disparate, puzzling components becomes novel, endearing, and almost endlessly amusing in a way that major studio output sometimes just can't achieve. 'The Fantastic Four' is a picture that will stand out for years to come in the annals of film history as a misstep, a blunder, an enigma, or otherwise Something Less Than. But if you're open to what it has to offer, on any level - welcome.",
19,5-tt0109770,The Fantastic Four,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109770/,A laugh riot for comic book fans,"I am almost a two decade old human who's been reading comics most of my life.  I'm not a huge fan of the Fantastic Four, but I'm fairly familiar with them.  In 1994, Roger Corman (B-movie legend) produced the first, I think, feature length Fantastic Four film.  The result was such pure schlock that it was never given a release.  Still, copies exist, mostly on the net and at conventions.  If you're looking for a laugh and can find a copy do yourself a favor and check this thing out.  The film basically retells the FF's origin and an encounter with Doctor Doom and a villain named The Jeweler, essentially the Mole Man with a penchant for petty larceny.  As is the case with these comic book movies, everything has to tie into everything, so the FF play a vital role in Dr. Doom's creation, and he and the Jeweler play a vital role in theirs.  First, I'd just like to mention that despite everything that went bad in this movie, I actually sort of liked the guy that played Doom.  He doesn't get many decent lines, but when he does he hits them.  The armor looks pretty good too.  As for the rest...it's a dirty, dirty mess.  Bad plots, bad acting, bad effects, bad everything basically.  Boos especially to Jay Underwood, bringing new meaning to the word overacting as Johnny Storm.  He's not overacting, he's ultracting.  As for the FF, well they all sort of look right, and Sue's played by a very attractive actress, but they just don't seem like a real team.  For one thing they have no reason for Sue and Johnny to go into space.  In an early section Ben and Reed go to visit the two, Johnny's like 8 and Sue's about 12.  It only stands to make their eventual romantic pairing a helluva lot creepier.  The Thing costume looks more reptilian than anything else, not very rocky, and the only time the Human Torch is really a Human Torch he looks like the Silver Surfer tinted red.  I could type for hours, but I think the scene that best sums it up is a climactic encounter featuring the aforementioned not-so-Human Torch.  He's racing a laser beam, and he eventually destroys it with a punch.  Yes, a punch.  A laser beam.  With a punch.  Then he flies around and goes ""Yippeee!"" a whole lot, whereupon the camera tilts down and he flies back TOWARD EARTH.  Evidently Reed the intellectual forgot to inform Johnny that fire doesn't exist in the vacuum of space.  This and many other scenes operate like Looney Toones, if the character doesn't know they are over a cliff, they don't fall.  I laughed, I cried, I was glad it was never released.",

If you don't think that you can enjoy a film by revelling in it's badness then do not watch this, because you will hate it.

21,0-tt0182060,The Man Who Saves the World,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0182060/,Ah Star Wars from Turkey,"Come on folks; this is George Chung meets Star Wars; somewhat tainted with nationalist and religious motifs... Otherwise, it is a helluva movie. For example, I love the scene where the pilots are bending their heads down (and bending over their knees?) to emulate the effect of diving with their tie-fighters. Or, vipers... That is one-of-a-king special fx. Love the helmets, by the way.  Aliens in the film can kill you out of laughter. Somewhere in the galaxy far, far away; these Turkish pilots riding on Imperial tie-fighters are using the karate-do to save the world. They ain't need phasers or other weapons. The power is strong in these two.   However, I seriously think the director did not mean to steal, er, lend, some of the Star Wars footage. At leastI suspect that was not his intention. Film's poster suggests otherwise, anyway. (see at http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/tr/8/8b/Afisdunya.jpg for yourself) It clearly states Galactica on it. I guess Cetin Inanc did not know the difference. Still some villains looked suspiciously Cylon through (tin cookie boxes were provide for the shining armor), with other monsters bearing a stiking resemblance to Battlestar Galactica daggit of Boxey, Muffit II...When to come to think of it, they also resemble the Cookie Monster.  Music is also great throughout; particularly with the fights scenes on the planet surface, the aliens riding horses and just the right music at the background you expect Indiana Jones to jump in the fun at any moment. anyway... Or, as the score changes, maybe Han Solo will show up... Or, Indiana Jones...   But it is not the worst film of the world. There is worst. Trust me. Try ""Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women."" This is actually a re-edited version of a film previously released in the US as ""Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet"" (1965), which itself was an edited and dubbed version of the Soviet film ""Planeta Bur"" (1962). Hence, the US rocket-ships journeying to Venus bear the red star of the USSR.  And the ""prehistoric women"" do not appear in the original Russian film from which this was made. They were later added on. So, in this third version, Mamie Van Doren and several other well-endowed beauties lay around on rocks by the ocean and make thoughtful faces while they have a telepathic debate concerning the ""alien invaders"" from Earth. The girls worship a dead pterodactyl until the end of the film, then they pull the wrecked robot from the ocean and start worshiping it instead (proof positive that a blond is a blond, regardless of what planet she's from).  The cosmonauts and the girls never come face to face -- which is no surprise, of course, since their scenes were filmed six years apart on two separate continents.  Another favorite of mine is ""Assignment: Outer Space..."" As Rich Meyer puts it ""There's a scene where an astronaut tries to escape a crash by jumping down to one of Mars' moons... Suddenly, there's an explosion when his ship hits. Unfortunately, the person handling the mattes was apparently sleeping that day, because you see an explosion in front of a bunch of buildings and behind a Chevy. Here we are in deep space near the Red Planet and there's a Chevy on a street in Italy. One of the most jarringly funny scenes I ever saw in a grade z movie...""

Danny Lee is chosen to become Infra-man when Earth is threatened by a race of interstellar demons.

That's because one of the Dragon's protégés was involved with directing the fight scenes. The whole cast seems to be in on the joke and no one takes it too seriously. Harmless family fun.

Marking China's first foray into the superhero genre, this 1975 Shaw Brothers Studio contribution to the fledgling subgenre is absolutely unforgettable.

I'll give it 2 1/2 stars out of ten, maybe. The plot is stupid and full of holes. Aliens fight on earth for some reason and kill this guy with green skin, who drops his laser gun. A loser that everyone picks on (for good reason) finds this gun and starts blasting everyone and everything that did him wrong. Especially hilarious are when he blows up a pinball machine (did it take his quarter?) and when he blows up a billboard that says simply ""Star Wars"" (Huh?). It's every bit as bad as it sounds. Roddy McDowell actually appeared in this movie - he must have been hurting bad for a movie role. Just remember, according to Leonard Maltin, this is better than ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" (which only got two stars). Worth watching once on its own for camp, but recommended especially for MST3K. The episode doesn't run on TV anymore and can't be found on Rhino, though, so it's tough to find. Pretty bad.

Teen angst, bullying, small-town doldrums in the 1970's. I remember the 70's and it was about this dirt-poor culturally. We didn't have Internet, plasma TV, cell phones, or CD's. We had portable tape players and we used pay phones. Third, you have to love Kim Milford's impression of a cooked Mark Hamill. Come on!

It's sooo bad that it sucks you in and you feel compelled to see it through to the bitter end (ack, make it stop.....).

I loved the old cartoon and toys when I was a kid, but this movie just does not have what it takes to be good in any way.  First of all, the story is terrible. Bringing He-Man to the cheesy 80s United States was a major mistake that could not be overcome. I mean, where's Prince Adam and Eternia? All we ever see of Eternia are 8 guys in bad costumes looking up at a projection of Skeletor on a stage.   The plots of the cartoons were actually totally superior (which is sad).  Dolph Lungdren is big, but has absolutely no charisma as He-Man. The other characters are simply there for the sake of being there. There is no connection between characters that shows any emotion. Not so ironically the best acting comes from teenager Courtney Cox. She doesn't have good lines, but at least she comes across as sincere, which is a talent of hers.  Evil-Lyn and Skeletor's mercenaries are completely wasted. Evil-Lyn does nothing other than continually walking onto scenes leading the drone troops.  We don't get to know any of these characters. In one of the many ""what could have been"" moments, Evil-Lyn puts an electronic choker around the teen boy's neck. The director stays on a dumb side-angle two shot of the two of them, when a good director at that moment would have gotten close-ups of them or of the device. We could then have seen the fear in the boy's eyes, or the glimmer of evil in Evil-Lyn's. Finally, when we do see a close-up it is way too late to evoke any emotion at all - the moment has passed. I could go on and on about such similar moments, but this is what distinguishes good directors from bad. Do you think Spielberg would have missed that moment?  Ultimately, the cheesy 80s decor, weak costumes, and awful opening titles also betray the film. Langella can't even save it with his hamming. It probably shouldn't have been made and came almost two years after He-Man's heyday of 1983-5. The effects were not able to do what was necessary and most of all, there are so many great characters from the toys and cartoons that are absent. Where's Stratos, Ram-Man, Trap-Jaw, Mer-Man, etc.???

MK had some terrific fight scenes, such as the brilliant Cage/Scorpion fight in the forest, the great Liu Kang/SubZero fight, and the cool finale with Shang Tsung.  Annihilation didn't have any fight scenes up to the quality of those three, many of the fight scenes made no sense, and the finale was horrible.

Why did Smoke maticulously break every window in that random building before fighting Sonya and Jax?  What was the point of having Liu Kang turn into a dragon?

38,10-tt0307109,The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0307109/,admirable in its intent; mixed results,"Made for an inconceivably paltry $40,000 and change, ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"" is a spoof of all those low budget sci-fi monster movies that played on double bills (usually in drive-ins) in the 1950's. Many of those films achieved renewed life on Creature Features-type TV shows during the 1960's and 1970's, and eventually ended up as fodder for ridicule on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000."" Filmed in glorious black and white, ""Skeleton"" tells the tale of a scientist and his wife who head to the mountains to locate a recently landed meteorite out of which he hopes to extract a rare and precious element known as ""atmosphereum"" (though no one can explain, with any degree of specificity, what it is exactly that the precious element does). At the same time, two outer space aliens land in the forest near where the couple is staying and accidentally unleash one of those infamous rubberized mutants into the area, who proceeds to terrorize the local citizenry and carry the heroine off in a gesture of interspecies romantic attachment. Finally, we have the mysterious Lost Skeleton of Cadavra itself which has been left lying dormant in a cave just waiting for someone to bring it the atmosphereum it needs to put some get-up-and-go into it.  Given the sheer silliness of the premise, I wish I could say that I liked ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"" more than I did. For one thing, the movie does a beautiful job capturing the look, sound and overall ambiance of the films it is parodying, and, for that, director Larry Blamire and cinematographer Kevin F. Jones deserve hearty praise. In addition to the black and white photography, the film captures with perfect fidelity the atrocious costuming and chintzy special effects that served as the hallmarks of that benighted genre.  The problem, however, is that once the style has been established, Blamire, as the film's writer, doesn't seem to know quite what to do with it. Although the deliberately flat and corny dialogue and the arch mannerisms of the actors are amusing for awhile, after about the first fifteen minutes or so, we get the point and want the film to move on. We laugh the first time we hear the scientist declare generically, ""I've come out here to do science,"" but after about the third time around, the joke loses its freshness. The film also does an effective job satirizing gender roles in the 1950's as well as the preposterous way in which sci-fi movies from that time period used generic-sounding terms to make themselves appear to be scientifically literate. Again, all that is funny at first, but it wears thin very quickly. Indeed, from past experience we've discovered that this sort of movie genre parody seems to work best in small doses; when it is dragged out to the extent of a full length feature film, it overstays its welcome.  This is not to denigrate the actors who have a blast hamming it up for the camera, and I do really appreciate what it is the makers of ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"" are trying to do. The problem is that it's never very easy to make good movies out of bad, and this film, once the novelty of it has worn off, becomes just about as unendurable as the movies it is parodying. Perhaps the filmmakers fell victim to that old conundrum of trying to make fun of something that is already laughable to begin with.  Any moviemaker who can produce something even halfway decent out of little more than baling wire and a shoestring budget deserves our admiration and support. Thus, the makers of ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"" at least get points for trying, if not for succeeding in their endeavor.",

The other types of movies I mentioned worked because they were made as serious movies, at least for kids, and adults get a kick out of watching because of all the mistakes in them. This piece of schlock is one scene of DELIBERATE moronic humor after another.  For example, the constant references to science and scientists are a way to get us to laugh at an intentional mistake. Sorry, the repetition is exhausting after awhile.  Anyway, Lost Skeletons of Cadavra could have been a good spoof on 1950's monster movies. But it was a huge disappointment.",

Come on lads if you're six years old any movie featuring dinosaurs in the present day is a movie highlight  It goes without saying that my enthusiasim for THE LOST WORLD has waned in later life . It has a totally B movie quality to it and is rather unsophisticated . There is still some amusement to be had at the special effects . Nowadays thanks to the power of technology we can watch convincing dinosaurs thudding around but in the 1960s we had to put up with actors standing in front of some back projection pretending they're frightened of a couple of giant lizards with massive fins stuck on them .

With ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" still in production, 20th Century-Fox tried their luck at another family friendly sci fi adventure, securing director Irwin Allen for a remake of the O'Brien original, even retaining his services though not for stop motion animation, merely the cheapest effects possible, ordinary lizards posing as dinosaurs. What became an even bigger box office bonanza than ""Journey"" sadly looks quite pedestrian these days, the lone human cast member who offers any spark is the 70 year old Claude Rains in the central role of Professor Challenger, barnstorming to such a degree that he even lets out an Invisible Man laugh on one occasion. Top Billed Michael Rennie (""The Day the Earth Stood Still"") also fares well as a big game hunter, but the remainder simply leave little impression, particularly Jill St. John, whose annoying poodle should have gone the way of Gertrude the duck. We finally reach the South American plateau at the half hour mark, a few 'dinosaurs' creeping through the dense forest, one man eating plant who finds Jill a more tasty treat, and not one but two giant spiders who look more feeble than those concocted by Bert I. Gordon. The one hour point shows off an epic battle of monsters, lasting nearly two minutes before tumbling to their doom off a cliff, after which only a tribe of cannibals and volcanic lava present more danger for the party. Monitor lizards, an ordinary alligator, a tokay gecko and an iguana make poor substitutes for Willis O'Brien's genius, and the whole thing screeches to a halt with the hatching of the baby dinosaur (Tyrannosaurus Rex, of course) without returning to London. Allen's box office clout continued with ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"" and ""Five Weeks in a Balloon,"" then TV series such as VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA (utilizing stock footage from the feature film), LOST IN SPACE, THE TIME TUNNEL, and LAND OF THE GIANTS, switching gears for the new decade with mass destruction on a grand scale, the 'Master of Disaster' at the helm for ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" ""The Towering Inferno,"" ""The Swarm,"" ""Beyond the Poseidon Adventure,"" and ""When Time Ran Out.""",

The main problem is the lighting which is so poor it is hard often to see what is going on, not much better is the sound which is muffled so you can't make out the dialogue, the sets and costumes are historically inaccurate etc etc. On the plus side the acting isn't too bad, the plot is no more preposterous than your average episode of Dr Who but really save yourself 90 mins - watch a Jeremy Brett or even a Rathbone",

He was smaller than Watson, too soft spoken and looks like a cockney gangster. Modern actors just can't do convincing posh accents any more. Rubbish diction and even more rubbish script.  If it was a parody or a comedy it would merit 3 or 4 stars. As an example of a naff film it gets 10.

I think the humor was completely intentional... sorta a spoof on the old alien horror sci-fi films of the 50s, 60s maybe the 70s I'm guessing. I don't recall this film, maybe it was because it was a direct-to-video.  The lame hillbillies are better than the actual creature. They get so annoying that you can't wait for the creature to get them but you kinda want all of them to stick around just to hear the next dumb thing they say and do.

Instead the luckless Invader lands in the piney woods and some folks right out of Deliverance think they can capture him and maybe sell him to a carnival to exhibit. That's the plan these peckerwoods develop taking their NRA protected weapons out for a little alien hunting. Despite the efforts of one scientist who gets alerted by one of his students, one of the kids actually completed high school and is in university if you can believe.  This film is the creation of low budget independent film maker Don Dohler who used some of his kids in roles. They look good, but my cat could have done the dialog better.

If you are a Brandon Lee fan this movie is a must see.",
47,13-tt0099978,Laser Mission,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099978/,Low point of Brandon Lee's brief career,"I've considered Brandon Lee to be one of my favourite actors for a while. Of course, I'd never seen 'Laser Mission'. I may be a blind fan boy most of the time, but even I can't accept 'Laser Mission' as a Brandon Lee movie. Then again, I never intended to, as it was my first foray into a pack of fifty ""classic"" sci-fi movie, and obviously one of those movies that are amazingly and amusingly bad.  'Laser Mission' would have made a whole lot more sense if it DIDN'T have a plot. Unfortunately, there is a plot. A plot that lacks any coherence, and some 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' style plot holes and continuity blunders.  Brandon plays Michael Gold, a freelance spy (a mercenary, perhaps?) working for the CIA. Gold's mission is to get to Professor Braun (Ernest Borginine, I've been told he was a real actor sometime before appearing in this) before the bad guys do. It seems Professor Braun has come up with plans for a doomsday device, but not actually built it yet, ensuring his status on the border between normal scientist and mad scientist. Prof. Braun is hiding out in a fictitious African country, being chased by what are either German or Russian spies / headhunters, and Cuban soldiers (being the comic relief). In order to find Braun, Gold must make contact with Braun's daughter, an American veterinarian and KGB spy. That's all I understood. I stopped trying to make sense of things after a while.   We all know plots are generally neglected in action movies, right from the Hollywood blockbuster to the b-movie with a tiny budget. That doesn't mean that a plot has to be so mind bendingly stupid that all you can do is laugh. A simple revenge story will suffice, not some crazy story that would probably be suited to a James Bond movie if it made a little sense. On the other hand, judging by 'Die Another Die', it won't be long before 007 ends up in a 'Laser Mission' remake. In fact, this does reminds me a lot of Jackie Chan's 'Armour of God 2: Operation Condor', both in story and location.  I think director BJ Davis assumed that lots of explosions would make up for the lack of any quality fight scenes in the film. It sure looks that way, but I'll give Davis credit: It must have taken tremendous talent to get Brandon Lee to look absolutely terrible in a fight scene. Half of the fights consist of stunt men diving in Brandon's general direction, and Brandon doing something to make it look he is actually fighting with the waves of diving stunt men. How symbolic is the fact that the best fight scene in the movie (a very ordinary scene by normal standards) is partially obscured by a horse's ass (I thought they used camels in the desert, and just where did that horse come from anyway?). Again, all you can do is laugh. Or cringe. At least the car chase is almost exciting.  As much as I hated 'Blind Vengeance', I have to admit that even 'Blind Vengeance' had better production values than this. However, 'Blind Vengeance' didn't have any rock ballads. Rock ballads make anything better. In this case, we have a rock ballad called 'Mercenary Man' that is played nearly non-stop throughout the whole movie. Apparently it was composed by none other than David Knopfler, once the guitarist of Dire Straits.   'Laser Mission' is a terrible, incredibly cheesy b-grade action movie. It'll either make you laugh, or make you cringe. For what it's worth, I laughed - 2/10",
48,8-tt0052077,Plan 9 from Outer Space,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052077/,Totally Inept In Every Way!,"Say what you will about it, PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE is not the worst movie ever made. It is, however, the most incompetent, with unbelievable ineptitude seeping from its every orifice. And that's what makes it fun.  The ""plot"" concerns aliens and their you-can-see-the-strings-attached flying saucers seeking (gasp!) domination of Earth. To help them in their evil quest, they borrow a page from NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD by raising the dead from their graves to serve as a zombified army. Now it's up to hapless earthlings - led by moronic police, clichéd army officials and feeble-minded airplane pilots - to stop them.  The storyline serves as little more than a front for the pure anti-genius of director Ed Wood to shine through. The most famous quirk is the employment of Bela Legosi as a star. Legosi, bless his heart, died three years before the film's release. No matter, said Wood, who sought to base his low-budget creation around a few scant minutes of unused silent footage of the horror icon. Wood is to be commended for his ambitious, if not inappropriate, attempt. What really makes the illusion crumble is Legosi's hilariously obvious stand-in, who, not blessed with much resemblance to the deceased actor, compensates by inexplicably covering most of his face with a cape.  The Legosi gimmick may get all of the attention, but the truth is PLAN 9 would have been just as horrendous without it. Take the dialog, which must be heard to be believed. When a laser ray suddenly morphs Legosi's zombie into a skeleton, a bystander is heard to note, ""He wasn't like that a minute ago!"" Very observant. Then there's the head alien henchman, smirkingly reminiscent of a '50s TV announcer, who tries hard but is about as convincing as Pauly Shore as Al Capone. ""You're all stupid... stupid, stupid!"" he tells the earthlings during an unimpressive temper tantrum. (Thankfully one of the good guys then proves how intelligent we really are... by punching the alien's lights out!).  Other absurdities abound. There are times when it appears Wood had to stop the camera so he could think of what to do or have the characters say next. A woman being chased by the zombies ""trips"" over nothing not once, but twice. Presumably sturdy tombstones fall over. After being brought back to life, burly Inspector Clay can't climb out of his grave. Policemen belittle a woman for not wanting to be alone with murderous creatures roaming the grounds. The same footage of Legosi walking out of the graveyard is used over and over again. No other film has given the viewer such little credit. Wood simply shrugged his shoulders at the glaring errors and must have thought, ""Well, heck, who pays attention to these things?""  What really allows PLAN 9 to succeed (to some degree) despite itself is the fact that it's so damn innocent. It doesn't seem Wood was trying to be campy; he really thought he had a winner. To his eternal credit, he did create something truly memorable, just not in the way he intended.",

But it is also really fun, and in some small way very much a precursor to great films like ""Night of the Living Dead"". And it was a nice showcase for Tor Johnson and Vampira.

By some unfortunate accident, they fall into the opening... only to emerge in a lush, flowering land full of verdant views and large, Alice-in-Wonderland-ish mushrooms. After meeting Toad, an ebullient native of this strange land, they learn that their princess has been kidnapped by a large, spiky-shelled creature named King Koopa. Vowing to earn their return to the home they know by rescuing this princess, Mario and Luigi overcome both the natural challenges of the environment of the Mushroom Kingdom as well as the attempts by Koopa's minions to thwart their advance. After overcoming the tests of mettle and might, and finding their way through labyrinthine castles, Koopa is defeated and the princess is found.  See now, how hard was that? The game *itself* has pretty much everything you need to make a movie about it... sure, you'd need some witty dialogue and an awful lot of special effects, but it's nothing that, say, *43 MILLION DOLLARS* couldn't do.  What you *don't* need are spurious and inane spring-loaded-rocket-jumping shoes, unnecessary connections to *wildly inaccurate* representations of evolutionary theory, awkward attempts to smoosh poor representations of unimportant baddies from every game into an hour and a half, or Dennis Hopper. They can jump high because it's a parallel universe, goombas are just creatures that evolved from whatever other creatures there were millions of years ago in that universe, and King Koopa is giant, spiky-shelled thing that looks *absofreakinglutely nothing* like Dennis Hopper. No, a spiky blond dye job on your head does not make you look like an evil reptilian tyrant - and it doesn't take the place of a shell.  Sadly, the Super Mario Bros. Movie makes the same mistake that virtually every other video-game movie has made: it flagrantly and arbitrarily makes stuff up that not only doesn't have *anything* to do with the game, but furthermore seems to perversely go so far off-course from the fun and adventurous tone of its source material as to make my childhood memories grit their teeth and softly weep.",

It is self-evident that there is a lack of imagination, especially recently, in the kids film genre, and this is where Super Mario Brothers earns the 7 out of 10 that I have given it.

Of course, with that title this film is irresistible, but it's also rather dull. Horror fans hoping for werewolf action will be disappointed to learn that the werewolf scenes are limited to a couple of brief fights and murders with characters wearing what look like reject masks from an old Lon Chaney movie.  For much of the running time this is a straightforward biker flick, padded out with some very bad acting and lots scenes of bikers riding down an empty highway in the blazing sunshine while music blares on the soundtrack.

The movie's problems are so vast that if you had a notebook and pen and were writing down the flaws as you went along you are guaranteed to have a full notebook. Seeing as there is a word limit on IMDb I can't do a notebook's worth of flaws, but I'll mention the main problems in as simple a way as possible. I'll apologise in advance though because after reading the reviews here that described the badness of the movie so well I thought to myself what else is there left to say, so if you don't like repetition you might not want to read on.  Monster a-Go-Go is very badly made. And I don't just mean rushed editing or the like, I mean a proper amateur's job all round. The camera work was often enough to make what was going on on screen incoherent and the sets looked as though they were going to fall over any minute. And not in quite some time have I heard dialogue this horrendous(you'll be laughing out loud at its cheesiness and irrelevance), and the fact that it's badly recorded doesn't help. As for the story, what story? Almost nothing happens, and when something does happen it is done in a dull way and never comes together as a whole. The ending is one of those screw-the-audience endings and the absolute worst in this regard, it actually makes you feel cheated, you do not want to feel that watching a movie. The characters are useless, even the ridiculous-looking monster, and to say that the acting is like watching robots is an insult to robots. The music is the best thing about the movie, but that's not saying very much.  To conclude, every bit as bad as its reputation.

But on the other hand, I don't really see a reason to bash this production entirely. It's obvious that Messalina doesn't aim for being a masterpiece, as it was made by a bunch of nutballs disposing over some leftover sets and scenery of a previously made film about the Roman Empire. This film actually is a spoof ahead of its time. The jokes and unsubtle references aren't very funny, but it all becomes hilarious because of its cheapness. The characters are extremely stupid and the humor is pure slapstick (some of the fart jokes here even outshine the Zucker bros. films). The inferior plot merely handles about the infamous Empress Messalina. While her husband Claudius does whatever he can to make the people of Rome like him, she screws around with every male that comes in her sight. There absolutely is no continuity in this film and the acting is painfully bad. Yet, it is the light-headed and goofy atmosphere (along with the sleazy acts of Di Lorenzi) that prevents you from turning it off.

I'm a big fan of MST3K, and a lover of many so-called ""bad movies"". Cinematic weirdness is my way of life. So I decided to give this one a shot again. It's strange how I can see how I've evolved, in comparing my reactions during the two periods in which I was familiar with this film.  All of the highlights of the film involve the demon Pitch, sent to Earth to...seemingly do little more than frustrate Santa Claus slightly. Or at least that's what he's competent enough to do in the film. You'd think Satan would have more reliable deputies. He manages to turn three little boys against Santa, and plays some strange pranks on him, all while prancing around the sets to goofball music in a way that was probably meant to be mildly funny for children, but turns out to be unintentionally hilarious for adult bad movie buffs like me.  This is really only a ""bad"" movie if you choose to take it seriously. There is a strange ridiculousness to it that is unlike anything I've ever seen in a movie that will leave ""normal"" audiences in the 21st century befuddled, while leaving those of us with a taste for the bizarre in hysterics.

Now I have, and my suggestion to everyone is - lighten up. Yes, it's bad. The sets are dreadful - worse than you used to see on Saturday morning kids' shows. The special effects are weak - although to be honest I've seen worse portrayals of space flight. And the costumes are hilarious - especially the polar bear and the robot. But come on - you have to admit that there's a certain ""cuteness"" to the story of Martians coming to earth to kidnap Santa Claus so that he can bring happiness to their children. All the characters are pretty one- dimensional. There's good guys and bad guys and fun guys and kids from both Earth and Mars. No one gets particularly well developed. And then, of course, there's Santa. In all honesty, I thought John Call did a decent job as the jolly old man. In this age of high tech special effects and big budget movies there's no doubt that this looks pretty weak - and even by the standards of 1964 it was still pretty weak. But it's good fun, and for the fun alone I don't think it deserves its reputation as one of the worst movies ever. What's left to say, except - ""Hurray for Santy Claus!"" 4/10",

65,4-tt0102034,Highlander II: The Quickening,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102034/,It's hard to imagine a sequel that alienates fans more than this one.,"""Highlander II"" makes one of the worst mistakes a sequel can make...ignoring the plot of the original film. This is even worse when there is a huge cult following. The first """"Highlander"" one was enjoyable and engaging...the sequel clearly was written by folks who never saw the original film as so much contradicts it....which is guaranteed to make fans hate the sequel...which DEFINITELY is true as the film has a pathetic overall score of 4.2! The original? 7.1!  In the original, Ramirez (Sean Connery) was an important character....an important character who died in the story. Yet here, once again, in the sequel we have Ramirez....again! How? By showing needless flashback scenes...and considering the sequel takes place decades after the first film, this is an annoying choice...as well as a lazy one. But that's not enough...despite being beheaded, he does somehow get sent to 2024! And, to make it worse, the film ALSO is a sci-fi film...set years after the original!  So is the film worth seeing? And, is it as bad as 4.2? No. It is pretty bad and completely betrays the fans of the first film...which is confusing as I read through reviews and some of these die-hard fans actually claim to love this sequel and think it was a work of genius!  The worst thing about it, clearly, is the nonsensical sci-fi plot....it's not only confusing but bad. Also, having Connery in a sequel (he would have been fine in a prequel) was a bad choice. Also, some of the problem is Christopher Lambert's performance as an old man. Instead of being convincing, he wasn't because his idea of an old man was to whisper all his lines! It just didn't make sense. You can also blame the director for not catching this...or caring enough to change it. Other bad things were explosions just for the sake of explosions, the many anachronisms and contradictions as well as goofs (the IMDB goof section is VERY long). This all just seem to point to the notion that at a certain point they filmmakers gave up on even trying to make a good film.  By the way, as bad as the film is, I could really identify with the angry woman who gave MacLeod the finger and then bashed him on the head with a beer bottle. I am sure I'm not the only one and I hope to think she was doing it for all the fans!",

The sad thing is that it had a lot of potential -- it _sounds_ like it could be a great film if you just look at the plot.  It's just too bad that Joe Esterhas can only write comedy when he's not intending to.  I pretty much hold Human Highway as my measuring stick of Bad Movies. Like Highway, it's only 80 minutes and feels like it's much longer, but it doesn't seem as relentlessly bad.  There's actual bits where you might have a single, solitary ""heh"" at some of the jokes.  The third act is by far the worst, though, where half of it is reused footage from earlier in the movie... and well, the whole bit with the Tarzan Yell I _don't_ get at all.

I'm somewhat of a connosieur of bad films, and that just isn't the case.  It's competently put together from front to back, but the script definitely could have used another draft or two.  At its worst, it's just unfunny, not mind-bendingly horrible as some would have you to believe.  Certainly if you know nothing about the inner workings of Hollywood you won't understand the references and almost none of it will be funny.  I'm sure there were lots of references I didn't understand -- I get the feeling people working in Hollywood would get more out of this movie than the rest of us.  One odd reference is the repeated name of ""Michael Ovitz"" throughout the movie.  It appears in the song ""I Wanna Be Michael Ovitz"" in the soundtrack, there's a ""Paging Dr. Ovitz..."" in the background in a hospital, etc.  It's not quite clear what writer Eszterhas's feelings toward Ovitz are -- does he hate him or look up to him?  Another thing I don't understand is why director Arthur Hiller felt he had to change his credit to ""Alan Smithee"", except that it's amusingly appropriate.  Looking at the film, I can't imagine that it was changed too radically in the editing, except  perhaps the ultra-acidic put-downs on the title cards that introduce new characters.",

""The Room"" is exceptional in that it's intended as an edgy independent psychological drama. To see a ""Plan 9 From Outer Space""-style version of that genre is even funnier! This film is absolutely bizarre. The dialogue is at once very childlike and yet it tries to tackle ""heavy"" themes like adultery, terminal illness, drug abuse and the like. As a result, it feels like it was written by an alien from outer space. And when you see The Room's protagonist, who is also the director, writer and producer, you'll see that he very likely IS an alien from outer space! It's absolutely unbelievably, jaw-droppingly awful... And highly recommended!",

""The Room"" is a terrible amateurish movie that becomes hilarious and cult so bad it is. The story is absolutely silly, without continuity and laughable dialogs giving the sensation that was written by a high-school teenager.

72,2-tt0369226,Alone in the Dark,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0369226/,shockingly bad,"This movie succeeds at being one of the most unique movies you've seen. However this comes from the fact that you can't make heads or tails of this mess. It almost seems as a series of challenges set up to determine whether or not you are willing to walk out of the movie and give up the money you just paid. If you don't want to feel slighted you'll sit through this horrible film and develop a real sense of pity for the actors involved, they've all seen better days, but then you realize they actually got paid quite a bit of money to do this and you'll lose pity for them just like you've already done for the film. I can't go on enough about this horrible movie, its almost something that Ed Wood would have made and in that case it surely would have been his masterpiece.  To start you are forced to sit through an opening dialogue the likes of which you've never seen/heard, this thing has got to be five minutes long. On top of that it is narrated, as to suggest that you the viewer cannot read. Then we meet Mr. Slater and the barrage of terrible lines gets underway, it is as if he is operating solely to get lines on to the movie poster tag line. Soon we meet Stephen Dorff, who I typically enjoy) and he does his best not to drown in this but ultimately he does. Then comes the ultimate insult, Tara Reid playing an intelligent role, oh help us! Tara Reid is not a very talented actress and somehow she continually gets roles in movies, in my opinion though she should stick to movies of the American pie type.   All in all you just may want to see this for yourself when it comes out on video, I know that I got a kick out of it, I mean lets all be honest here, sometimes its comforting to revel in the shortcomings of others.",
73,6-tt0369226,Alone in the Dark,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0369226/,Spectacular Crap-fest,"I'm in no hurry to get in the boxing ring with director Uwe Boll, a man who has been known to use his pugilistic skills to silence his less favourable critics, but I have got to say that this horror/action film (apparently based on an Atari video game) is utterly diabolical—far worse than I ever expected (my opinion of Boll had been reasonably high after seeing Rampage, which was surprisingly effective).  The long-winded opening narration is the first clue that this is going to stink: ancient civilisations, evil creatures from another world, a secret organisation devoted to investigation of the paranormal, and a mad scientist experimenting on orphaned children are clumsily thrown together in an attempt to establish the background to the film, but they only succeed in confusing the viewer before things have even begun. Matters are made even more incomprehensible with a prologue that occurs '22 years ago' but which segues into the present day and proceeds to introduce even more mind-bogglingly random elements to ensure that even the most astute of viewers will be completely baffled.  As the film progresses, more and more nonsensical garbage is haphazardly thrown into the mix, Boll's pointless directorial stylisms making everything impossible to follow, with the occasional voice-over by Christian Slater (intended to help explain matters) only adding to the embarrassment factor. Ridiculous voice-overs aside, Slater's performance isn't all that bad, but his co-star Tara Reid is absolutely terrible and was clearly hired for her looks (yet she doesn't even have the decency to take off her bra during the obligatory sex scene!).  After much frenetic shooting, a smattering of reasonably fun gore, some choice snippets of lousy dialogue ('Some doors are meant to stay shut') and lots of naff CGI creature attacks, during which Boll throws in some lousy Indiana Jones-style adventure and a scene completely ripped off from James Cameron's Aliens (the Xenos—yes the monsters ARE called that—obliterate a team of soldiers, despite the use of automated sentry guns), the film wraps up leaving the viewer none the wiser about what they have witnessed.",

Repetition is the order of the day, the film opening with a baffling voice-over that repeats the phrases 'beautiful hill' and 'blue mountain' more times than anyone could ever care to hear. The film then proceeds to repeat the same supposedly sexy formula over and over, with Alucard/Dracula (Vince Kelley, alternating between a Jewish accent and Transylvanian) stripping each girl brought to him by his assistant Irving Jackal-man (Billy Whitton), tying them up, fondling their body, and biting them on the breast.  I guess this wouldn't have been too bad had all of the women in the film been absolute scorchers, but only two of the ladies are certifiably hot - the stranded motorist (Rebecca Reynolds) and Susan (Adarainne) - and only the latter gets her kit off.  The action occasionally strays into iffy territory with Jackal-man raping two of his victims (continuing to hump away even after one has died), but the majority of the film is pure 'meh!': badly shot, poorly edited, with lousy 'special effects' (including a fake bat on a stick), and a mundane jazzy lounge muzak soundtrack.",

When faced with the tyranny of an evil ninja empire run by an overweight accountant, our hero resorts to the only weapon a ninja can when faced with certain death - a 500cc racing motorbike.  In  a tense scene suitably offset with the mellow strummings of Pink Floyd,  Richard demonstrates some of his broad reportoire of jaw dropping action stunts that, quite rightly,  put Jackie Chan's efforts in the shade.  A must for all Harrison fans, serious action junkees and devotees of films spliced together in an incredibly obvious way to shift a few copies in the West.",

Even Speakman and Dudikoff became recognisable names, not just amongst die-hard fans of fight flicks, but with normal folk who arrived too late at the video shop to rent out the newest releases but didn't want to go home empty handed.  Richard Harrison, on the other hand, is a name that will probably only be familiar to those who weren't afraid to delve into the darkest depths of the dreaded bottom shelf (reserved for only the lowest budgeted Z-grade garbage). Sporting an ultra-macho Selleck-style 'tache and often seen clad from head to toe in a crap camouflage suit, Harrison was the star of many a Ninja film from legendary director Godfrey Ho, who would cobble his films together with little regard for logic or narrative cohesion.  Ninja Protector is a fairly unexceptional example of such a movie: the plot is typically all over the place, the result of Harrison's Ninja footage having been clumsily spliced together with an old Hong Kong film; ninjas materialise out of nowhere to do battle with each other, resulting in the usual frenetic sword-based martial arts mayhem; and the action is regularly punctuated by soft-core sex scenes featuring a selection of nubile Asian honeys. Those familiar with this type of junk may find it mildly entertaining for the duration, but the film sadly lacks any of the truly bizarre stuff that occasionally qualifies such ninja nonsense as unmissable.",

Dialogues are painfully bad in this movie, as is the story itself.  The acting is also below any standard you would expect from such an expensive movie. Jeremy Irons was especially shocking, his performance was very pathetic and flat, as if this would be a bad movie for three year olds. That was not acting, that was a torment ! I cried every time he appeared on the screen.  Thora Birch was also far, far below her level in 'American Beauty', obviously unable to tell how one should put a little life into her bad dialogue and flat character, and somehow even thinking that that was her own fault.  If at all, the thief Snails (Marlon Wayans from Scary Movie) had quite some good moments in his slapstick scenes, the only good moments in the whole movie. Unfortunately they don't last long. Wayans seems to have a talent to shine even in the worst movies, however.  The performance of the main actor was also bad. His dull and cheap sunnyboy behavior really nerved me, and I saw absolutely no reason for his 'being special', but far more for 'being untalented'.  The effects where better than the story, but really not that exciting either.  Some people say fantasy is about stereotypes, but that doesnt mean you can forget all rules how to make up a good story ! This story was not worth getting on the screen. This story was also not worth getting such good actors and effects. This story was nothing but crap !  And I can't believe that Jeremy Irons and Thora Birch are such bad actors, they have proven they can do far, far better ! I can only guess it must have been the director who forced them to do such bad performances.  Definitely not recommended for anyone except maybe children below ten. Oh wait, they're not allowed ?

I thought I had missed something but it turns out the makers of this movie missed a lot. They missed the D&D part, this movie only makes a mockery of the game and any plot imaginable. There is no acting, no plot. The very spirit of D&D is completely trashed. One of the worst parts is this Wayans guy who plays a Brooklyn rogue wannabe which is pointlessly killed in the middle of the movie. The characters are hardly believable (how stupid must the two rogues be) not to mention the entire action and party (""Only you were meant to pass"").

Also of note is Wings Hauser who's embarrassing performance is easily the film's best asset.

I came to this knowing something of its history. It is based on magical principles as described in what was thought to be an authoritative book, and had to be produced on another island for fear of ""offending"" Balinese. This was underwritten by the corrupt government as an attempt to get foreign currency.  The reason I was excited was because I know a bit about Balinese religion. Its a sort of Haiti/New Orleans of the Pacific where old pantheism and ancestor worship mixes with the colonial religion. In this case, that wrapper a strange brew of old Hinduism with Buddhist rituals. And the whole is surrounded geographically by strident Islam which tends to make the minority religion stronger.  I know, for instance, that ritual and theatrical displays are at the heart of this magic. And I know that it is highly cinematic in its potential. Julie Taymor's work, even with her recent Beatles project is based on this inner ritual. There's a powerful old film, ""Legong"" that captures a bit of the genuine stuff, and is pretty darn haunting.  So imagine my surprise to encounter not something Balinese or even magical but Starwars in Indonesian garb. Yes, folks, Star Wars, most particularly the second film (now numbered what, 5?). You have the two young skywalkers, Yoda, the senior Jedi, the evil dark emperor (here a witch). Yes, you even have the levitation and light saber effects. The telekinetic objects lifted and thrown in battle.   What's taken from the old magical tradition are the notion of a disembodied head with attached ka who stalks villagers as a vampire. And the special power of vaginal blood, especially when accompanied and caused by a miscarried or aborted fetus. Its powerful stuff but made comic here by the Ed Woodish nature of the thing.

This is one of the finest foreign exploitation offerings. Most of its enjoyment comes from the utterly delirious and bizarre series of sequences presented here which make this one such fun to sit through. From seemingly omniscient tongues that have a mind of their own, bizarre black magic rituals, body transformations and full of trashy low-budget charm, there's a feverish intensity to the scenes here that oftentimes feels like it was simply throwing ideas out simply because they could. The initial meetings of the two out in the woods, where the witch uses the tongue to slurp up blood or writing markings on the body to the later scene of the witch engaging in ritualistic dances or the two transforming into animals creates a lasting visual impression here. The final half is where this one really takes a turn and becomes even more delirious and bizarre. The witch turning the student into a fanged being with only her head and interior organs dangling beneath her to go around and attack a random house with a pregnant woman about to give birth is a fantastic sequence, while the later moment showing the two transforming in detail into snakes and slithering off into the jungle together has some stellar moments here. The mid-air battle of the fireballs adds some nice action into it all while the idea that the witch can control her with various spells and transformations allows for some demented fun. Aside from being so bonkers, the film does have another positive quality. This one takes great care towards the supernatural and superstitions of locals, not being content to whip it out in just any scenario but only just to utilize it for effect and impact. Numerous times there's mention of it being warped or dangerous yet the whole film continually reverts back to its power being about those that wield it. While the two may indeed have the best of intentions about studying black magic, there's always the warped way in which the lessons take that provide the horror which is always brought back to how she uses it. Especially prominent is the use of the good magic to combat the witch as that creates a fine distinction between the two forms as seeing how the local priest uses his skillset against the witch offers plenty of supernatural thrills in the finale. These here allow this one a ton to like, as the only real issue to be had here is the low-budget quality to the special effects which always manage to look low-budget and it can ruin some scenes. Otherwise, there's not much to dislike here.  Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence and Language.",

The model work of toy trains, planes and buildings also sucks; and the script contains enough cliches like describing sultry heroine Mara Corday as ""a mathematician and systems officer"" engaged in ""Earth curvature calibration work"".  In reality the ""feathered nightmare on wings"" they're so impressed by would actually be pretty scary.

I feel like a bit of a hypocrite for criticising this film for being sick, given that many of my favourite movies can be described with the same adjective; but Nekromantik crosses a line, and it doesn't even do it in a way that's interesting. The movie features quite a few brutal and sickening scenes, but most of them have no relevance to the plot; and even the ones that do don't serve the film in the way that they should. Nekromantik looks like a trashy piece of crap, and make no mistake; that's exactly what it is. As if the title doesn't give it away, the plot handles the theme of necrophilia. We follow a sewage worker who brings home body parts for his twisted girlfriend. One day, he manages to lay his hands on a full corpse; and unlike most women, she is delighted with this present. We then get 'treated' to seeing the three of them (...) in bed together, etc etc and it's all very difficult to enjoy.  The film obviously wants to examine love; but it just continually fails. No points are made, even the fact that the girlfriend ends up choosing the corpse over her man isn't explored at all. It would seem that the sick pervert who wrote it had a great idea about making a film that handles two of life's most important elements; namely, love and death, but had no idea of exactly how he would go about doing it. The result is this film. Necrophilia is, undoubtedly, a perverse subject; but it's also one that automatically generates intrigue, yet this film also fails even in that respect. The whole plot line is just too silly to take seriously; and even if you look at the movie as a black comedy, it still fails because it's not funny. The necrophilia element isn't even the most shocking thing about this movie; the most shocking things are the animal violence (pointless), and the fact that some people actually like this film! If I really had to come up with positive things about Nekromantik, I would say that I liked the score; and the fact that it's not on for long is a very good thing. On the whole, this movie is a piece of garbage - don't waste your time! Wayward cinema has produced far more satisfying gore-porn flicks than this.",
88,16-tt0067148,Godzilla vs. Hedorah,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067148/,"Bizarre, nightmarish Godzilla outing","Initially I didn't really have much of any particular expectations to this 1971 entry to the ""Godzilla"" franchise. But still, I've been on a ""Godzilla"" marathon recently, so of course I sat down to watch ""Gojira tai Hedora"" (aka ""Godzilla vs Hedora"") as well.  Turns out that this was actually a really enjoyable movie, even one of the better older ""Godzilla"" movies. Taking into consideration that this movie was from 1971, then they actually fared quite well with the special effects.  As for the storyline, well ""Godzilla vs Hedora"" actually deviates dramatically from the usual one-minded track that the ""Godzilla"" franchise is known for. They introduced an environmental aspect to this movie, and it actually worked out well enough, given the fact that it wasn't a preaching that was pulled down over the heads of the audience.  The Hedora creature concept was actually interesting. Even brought a smile to the lips when it morphed into a flying ray-like creature. I hadn't seen that coming.  Godzilla is acting like he is on crack in this 1971 movie, and it was just a blast to watch him duke it out with Hedora.  All in all, this is an enjoyable and entertaining movie, and definitely one that you should take the time to sit down and watch if you enjoy the older ""Godzilla"" movies. I am rating ""Godzilla vs Hedora"" a solid six out of ten stars.",
89,10-tt0067148,Godzilla vs. Hedorah,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067148/,Campy Godzilla Fun,"Following the child-focused ""All Monsters Attack"" (1969), Godzilla returns as an ally of man in the battle against pollution, as personified (kaijufied?) by Hedorah (the Smog Monster)*. There are a number of stylistic changes from previous movies in the franchise, including James Bond-like opening credits, surreal psychedelic interludes (the fish-headed people at the 'go-go' club are memorable) and a number of odd animated inserts reminiscent of early 70's public service cartoons. The musical score, much of which sounds like background music for slapstick comedy or uplifting marches similar to the grating (but catchy) Gamera theme, is horrible. The franchise is still targeting younger audiences, so the central human character is a little kid (Ken Yano, played by Hiroyuki Kawase) who, among other things, comes up with the name for the new monster (Hedorah) as well as a method to destroy it. He also seems to have a psychic bond with Godzilla, and the last scenes of the film are straight out of ""Shane"" (1953, except that Shane is now a giant mutated dinosaur). Despite being a child-oriented film, ""Godzilla vs. Hedorah"" is much grimmer than any of the previous sequels, with human body counts after the monsters clash, on-camera 'deaths' of individuals (such as the gamblers or the driver of the truck crushed by Hedorah), and most jarringly, the 'melting' of people exposed to Hedorah's noxious exhalent (Ken encounters the gruesome partially-dissolved bodies of a number of these victims). Hedorah itself is so improbable looking that it might as well be accepted as a metaphor rather than a monster, but the titular fights are pretty good. The anthropomorphisation of Godzilla, who now constantly uses human-like gestures (almost rolling his eyes at mankind's ineffectual attempts to stop Hedorah), continues (although one delirious surprise in the film is the revelation that Godzilla can fly (!), a ridiculous-looking skill that would have come in handy in previous outings). All in all, ""Godzilla vs. Hedorah"" (the eleventh film in the franchise) while not a great kaiju film, is eccentric, imaginative and entertaining: a deviation from the downward slide that leads to the next two entries in the series (the woeful ""G. vs Gigan"" and ""G. vs Megalon""). (*these comments pertain to an English subtitled version of the film).",
90,4-tt0077904,The Manitou,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077904/,Amusing And Then It Goes Crazy,"The Manitou is one of the 'classic' b-grade 70's sci-fi horror movies and essentially what you would call a bad movie. But in its defense, it's not thoroughly atrocious like some. The movie starts off closer to a mystery style horror flick that isn't good but fairly entertaining. And then in the third act everything falls apart, when the hokeyness reaches and apotheosis and movie just loses control with a bonkers ending that seals its fate as junk.",
91,5-tt0077904,The Manitou,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077904/,Trash...But Really Great Trash,"The post-EXORCIST 70s produced a variety of quirky, old-fashioned horror films with big name stars whose careers were winding down but who were happy to still be working and who added a touch of class to the proceedings. PSYCHIC KILLER with Jim Hutton, TOURIST TRAP with Chuck Connors and SHOCK WAVES with John Carradine and Peter Cushing immediately come to mind. And then there's THE MANITOU. I saw this movie when it first came out in 1978 and thoroughly enjoyed it. There's something for everyone here... black magic, Native American lore, cool 1970s furnishings (check out Tony Curtis' pad -er- apartment), possession, a séance, demonic birth and a STAR TREK like finish. It's like a summing up of the themes of 1970s horror films with a few well placed shocks and one truly memorable sequence. Curtis takes the Bob Hope approach (complete with quips) to his role as a fake mystic who is suddenly confronted with the real thing. Susan Strasberg makes a suitably vulnerable heroine and Syrian born Michael Ansara is quite believable as an Indian medicine man (no Native Americans in 1978) brought in to fight the evil. Stella Stevens, Ann Sothern, and Burgess Meredith add fun to the proceedings and director William Girdler (ABBY, GRIZZLY) doesn't give you time to think long enough on how preposterous it all is. Sadly this film was to have been his ticket to the big time and would have been (it was a box office hit) had he not been killed in a helicopter crash while scouting locations for his next film. Avco Embassy for whom the film was made was sold to Norman Lear in 1982 and this and other Avco Embassy films disappeared into ownership limbo. Thanks to Anchor Bay THE MANITOU and other 70s A/E films like MURDER BY DECREE and WINTER KILLS have made it to DVD in beautiful widescreen transfers. THE MANITOU may be trash but it's really great trash and I'd rather be watching it than any number of present day horror films. Its well crafted approach to its material (no matter how ridiculous) rather than explicit effects from suffering victims makes it a guilty pleasure that I'll be happy to return to.",
92,3-tt0070122,Godzilla vs. Megalon,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070122/,Can't rate this masterpiece of amateurish film-technique,"This one is strictly for the kids, but it's still fun if you enjoy rubber suited actors destroying miniature sets (which I do). Megalon, a giant beetle from the sea, and Gigan, a praying mantis-like giant monster, are dead set on squishing puny humans. Enter size-shifting robot Jet Jaguar, who enlists the help of Godzilla to battle the two evil Kaiju. Jet Jaguar was the result of a contest Toho held where kids entered their idea for a new superhero and Jet was the winning entry by an elementary age student who was clearly a fan of Ultraman. Considered by many as one of the weakest Godzilla films, this is certainly among the corniest and the most juvenile of the many films, but I'll admit that I was entertained.",
93,5-tt0070122,Godzilla vs. Megalon,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070122/,Not bad,"I've probably seen Godzilla vs Megalon (1973), over 20 times in my life. I am a huge fan of these films. The good and the bad, but in times of need, I've been able to turn off my unbiased-button, in order to look at these in a straight-forward, critical way too. I've been watching the Showa Era series, steadily, since the 1970s, so I was used to seeing it in 4:3 all the time. Godzilla vs Megalon (1973), is much better in its original, theatrical, widescreen format, which includes, the Japanese language with English subtitles, available today and it looks great in the new 1080p restoration. This is not saying much towards the overall film, but you should compare the two (SD VHS 4:3 and 4K Blu-ray), someday and you'll see what I mean. Godzilla vs Megalon (1973), is not the worst Godzilla movie ever made, but it was the lowest point of the 1970s era, of Toho's, kaiju series. That's not saying much, considering the 1970s were brutal for Godzilla, across the board.  This era of Gojira was a rough-ride for the lizard-king. It moved the character towards a more kid-friendly, comedic, silly direction, that turned a force of nature into a giant boxing kangaroo. Godzilla vs Megalon (1973), also was the third film, out of the last four films, in the series, which had a kid as the main character, thus playing-up the kid-friendly angle of the film. It made perfect sense, that this was happening though. The creator of Gojira, Eiji Tsuburaya, had since passed away, but before he left, he had set-up Tsuburaya Productions, who was churning out, one of his other, great creations, Ultraman, at an incredible rate of episodes, per year, by the time we got to 1973. On top of that, there were tons of copy-cat, Ultraman shows, out there on Japanese TVs, playing all the time. This of course, influenced the Godzilla films to a degree, which explains his tag-team partner in Godzilla vs Megalon (1973), as the colorful robot, named Jet Jaguar.  Another obstacle Godzilla vs Megalon (1973), had to get through, that impeded its success, was the fact, that at the same time, an embattled, bankrupting, Japanese film industry, was feeling the pain and Toho had to slash budgets on their films, which really is felt in this film. This was the era of stock footage galore, with footage reused from numerous Godzilla movies, going all the way back to 1962. Even, as far back as, King King vs Godzilla (1962). In fact, they even took stock-footage from non-Gojira films. When Megalon goes behind the trees, while the military is shooting their death-rays at him, the shot of him dodging the rays from behind the trees, was taken from either, Frankenstein vs Baragon (1965) or the War of the Gargantuas (1966). I'm not sure which one, but it was one of those. All the stock-footage was used in the military gathering scenes, monsters destroying the city scenes and, parts of the fight-scenes with the monsters. The shot with Megalon's lasers blowing up the Mobile gas-station, weren't even his lasers. They were stock-footage shots of King Ghidorah's lasers, from about eight movies back. Budget-cuts always kill a movie.  There also is a question if these films really were intended for kids. There is enough in Godzilla vs Megalon (1973), that earned the film a PG rating in the U. S. and I'm pretty sure I saw an old poster, that had an R-rating on it, for somewhere in the world. You can clearly see why in the new, improved, restored, Japanese versions, that you can stream on Max or Tubi, currently today. So, don't be fooled. Godzilla vs Megalon (1973), is not really for kids, with a PG-rating for language, violence and some magazine nudity, plus there's even smoking. There is a scene depicting our good-guys, Roku and Hiroshi, breaking back into their house, so they can stop the bad-guys (operatives of the subterranean culture, known as Seatopia), and regain control of Jet Jaguar. They use a toy plane and fly it into the face of one of the saboteurs. He grabs his head with a glob of fake blood in his hand. Another guy gets thrown out of a truck, that has Playboy centerfolds taped to the back of the cab and he rolls down a cliff. Finally, another bad-guy, gets crushed by a huge rock. By the way, all of these scenes were deleted from the original American version, that was shown in the 1970s and all through their VHS releases, seen in the 1980s and 1990s. I think people think these films are for kids, because non-nerds think we are all 15 year-old kids. That is fine, but beware of false claims on target-audiences.  There are other miscues in Godzilla vs Megalon (1973). Things like, audio sound effect mistakes, like squealing tires on dirt roads. There is a scene were Godzilla is running, Keystone Cop-style. The final fight scene is one of the worst ever. It has the famous Godzilla scene, with him flying through the air (he actually makes a turn), with a drop-kick blow into Megalon, while Jet Jaguar secures the evil monster. Jet Jaguar and Gojira actually having, what looks like, a conversation, also enhances the silliness. It is pretty brutal. It isn't all bad news for Godzilla vs Megalon (1973). There is a cool contrast between the colors of Jet Jaguar's suit and the choice of colors, that inventor Goro (Godzilla legacy-actor, Katsuhiko Sasaki), and his friend Hiroshi, use for their cars. There also is a half-decent car-chase and Megalon attacking a dam is kind of cool too. For really big laughs, watch the English dubbed version. Then compare it to the Japanese version. Even though, I give Godzilla vs Megalon (1973), a Failed grade, I still recommend seeing it, because you have to see it to believe it. Then forget about it and enjoy the rest of the Gojira, kaiju, Showa-Era of films, by the great Toho Studios. Plus, it's a film series, so you have to watch it.  PMTM Grade: 3.8 (F+) = 4 IMDB.",
94,14-tt0048696,Tarantula,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048696/,Radioactive isotopes are at it again,"This is one of those films which starts off with a bang, slows down with a big lull in the middle section, and then finishes strong.  Kudos to the special-effects people to make the giant tarantula scenes look pretty good, even by today's standards some 50 years after this was made. Many times, the huge spider looks real while it's crawling down the road. I would like to have seen one or two more scenes of it in that middle section which would have kept viewers on edge throughout the film. Instead, it got a bit talky in spots.  Anyway, it still entertained and it was fun for me to see Leo G. Carroll, a guy I saw each week growing up watching ""Topper"" on television. Carroll played, by far, the most interesting character in this movie.  The acting was good in here, too, once again above '50s sci-fi standards. It was one of the better entries in the recently-released Sci-Fi Ultimate DVD set, offered at Best Buy. A pretty good transfer, too.",
95,15-tt0048696,Tarantula,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048696/,Prof. Deemer would have to work a LOT harder nowadays,"I've always wondered if director Jack Arnold could have raised higher should he have been able to work with big budget products and top stars casts. Arnold was a very smart filmmaker with a most direct and plain style that gave us such ""B"" classic films in different genres as ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon"" and ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" in the horror/sci-fi line, ""No name on the Bullet"" (Audie Murphy's best western no doubt) and even the fine comedy ""The Mouse That Roared"" (Peter Sellers was not a top star then). Who knows?   ""Tarantula"" is just another of Arnold's little ""B"" horror gems of the 50's, a most simple movie about insects turning huge to terrorize people, in this case the spider in the title. The film is interesting and enjoyable for fans of the genre (guilty!) and I remember it really scared me a lot when I saw it as a kid.  Though they would have never run for an Oscar John Agar, Mara Corday and Leo G. Carroll where very good in the main roles in a kind of film that was not about acting but about special effects and horrifying situations (just think for a second what it would be like to be chased by a hungry building size tarantula spider!).  All in all, ""Tarantula"" stands as a good piece in the ""B"" horror genre released by an intelligent director.",
96,16-tt0076009,Exorcist II: The Heretic,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076009/,0/10 don't waste your time,"Poor John Boorman. He has all these great ideas, but whenever he tries to put them to the screen, the result is so damn goofy you can't tell whether you're watching a metaphysical drama or a slapstick comedy (for more on this, see ""Zardoz""). His ""Exorcist"" sequel is miles below the original if you're looking for scares, but miles above it in terms of actual storytelling, plot, character development, etc. It's full of interesting ideas (the most interesting being the idea of pure goodness as a magnet for evil), and Regan turns into an angelic heroine out to stop the demon that once possessed her. But Boorman's wacko imagery, while fascinating in places (the doves, the locusts), tends to get a little TOO wacko, to the point where you can't help laughing (the hypnosis machine, Richard Burton putting out a fire with a wooden crutch, James Earl Jones spitting up a tomato).  If you can accept the fact that this is a completely different movie than the original, you might find that it's a pretty good movie on its own. Fantastic acting from Burton, a wonderful score, and some truly gorgeous visuals, especially the climactic scene in the house, make it one of the most underrated movies of all time. Even if some scenes leave you falling over with laughter.",

Okay, in addition to being completely hilarious, this is also the most pretentious movie ever made, (aside from The Matrix Reloaded).  Good thing Burstyn sat out for this turkey.  Please tell me that I didn't see James Earl Jones in a big locust suit.  Please tell me that I didn't see Oscar Winner Louise Fletcher being groped by a matted Linda Blair stand in and moaning (I am not making this up) in such a way that would make Ron Jeremy take notice. And what in the name of all things good and holy is a ""Synchronizer"" and what does it have to do with anything at all?  Why is Africa made of fiber-glass? Why is Richard Burton made of stone?  Oh, God.  They couldn't have made this worse if they had scripted it so.  Oh, wait...they did.  Well, for all its faults at least it's not a desperate attempt by a major studio to milk whatever money they can out of a pre-existing hit by combining a-list actors, and a controversial visualist director, with a hastily prepared screenplay that shares little of the spirit and intelligence of its predecessor, producing a boring, although often laughably pious bastardization of something far, far greater.  Oh wait....it is.  If you're a fan of bad movies, you have reached Zen here.  If you're a fan of the original Exorcist, run, just run and don't look back.
