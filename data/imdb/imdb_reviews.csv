there is a new nuclear arms race underway superman is forbidden to interfere with earth s internal affairs however a little boy s letter and taunting from the paper s owner david warfield superman decides to make a declaration at the un to destroy all of the world s nuclear weapons lacy warfield mariel hemingway is the new woman at the paper who falls for clark kent meanwhile nephew lenny jon cryer helps spring lex luthor gene hackman from prison work detail using a strand of superman s hair lex luthor creates nuclear man the movie is pretty boring and even more silly than all the others there are a lot of problems with the ridiculous nature of this movie nephew lenny is annoyingly silly the premise of the world politics is stupid the idea that superman would reveal his identity and kiss it away just to ease his mind seems wrong the effects may have actually gotten worst however the biggest mistake is the idea that superman would get rid of all the nuclear weapons during wwii superman never really battle the nazis or the japanese directly it was a matter of superman not be a god like figure to direct and interfere with mankind s wars if superman is to act like god then the reaction from the earth s political and commercial powers have to act more realistically this movie is too silly and simplistic dealing with world politics the whole thing is a wrong idea,negative
superman iv the quest for peace is a good movie but it was a failure in my opinion it was great seeing the superman cast back together again including gene hackman who we have not seen since superman ii this time alexander and ilya salkind were not producing the movie instead menaham golan and yoram globus the owners of cannon films were producing if you ask me the salkinds knew how to make a superman movie better than those two in superman iv superman hears the threat of nuclear war over and over and so he decides that he will rid the world of every nuclear weapon known to man at the same time lex luthor has broken out of jail again and this time his sidekick is his dorky nephew lenny the two criminals create a device that they put on one of the nuclear weapons and that ends up creating nuclear man nuclear man has the same powers as superman but the only difference is that nuclear man gets his power from the sun while all of this is going on the dailey planet is being controlled by a tycoon and his daughter who has her eye on clark kent so superman has a big job here save the world from nuclear destruction i am going to say that anyone who has seen the first three superman films then just go ahead and see iv because it would be a shame to not see the film that is last in the series but in my opinion i did not like it much i think alexander ilya salkind would have made a hell of a last movie,negative
very odd and very short color film that tries as a horror comedy there are no opening credits the film opens with a man wearing a lab coat with mad doctor on his coat pocket he talks to the audience for a while and then we get an announcer read to us who is in the movie who made it who edited it etc while we see a man in a gorilla suit in different settings looks like an amateur film plot concerns a group of sorority pledges who have to spend the night in a haunted house the house has a mad doctor a gorilla a hunchback an oriental woman and a werewolf in the basement whole thing is done in fun with gorilla frequently holding up signs with one word phrases,positive
the acting costumes and dialog for monsters crash the pajama party are all quite terrible in fact it is one of the cheesiest films of an era known for its cheesy teen movies but it still manages to entertain mostly because it never takes itself seriously and often makes fun of itself because of this the bad film has a genial quality about it that make it goofy fun among the best examples is the guy in the gorilla suit he not only introduces the film but makes commentary using giant signs with words printed on it also as the film is introduced a bizarre narrator says lots of strange and occasionally funny remarks another is the mad scientist who wears a lab coat that says mad doctor right on it because this film is intentionally bad i really do not think it is appropriate to give it a numerical score for those who love the silly monster films of the 1960s it is well worth seeing for anyone just wanting to see a good film then it is definitely one you should skip harmless fun,positive
while the batman franchise has been much maligned in recent years due to the disappointing performance of the last live action film forever was second in quality only to the first bat film it added color back into a gotham that had gotten way too claustrophobic and brought the tone back to something resembling the comics jim carrey is a scene stealer and dead on as the riddler and val kilmer is the perfect bruce wayne and batman tommy lee jones does a great turn as two face unfortunately he is not given enough to do and therefore comes across too cartoony minus the angst of the character in the comics one other big complaint is the new score gone are danny elfman s orchestrations elliot goldenthal s music would have been fine if not for his predecessor most people tend to lump this one in the lousy section it seems but it was one of the biggest movies of 95 and a very faithful adaption overall now if they would only release the director s cut,positive
some people talk about the stick of straw that broke the camel s back meaning when something reached the tipping point so when did the batman franchise go bad well batman forever was getting silly but it still had jim carrey to steal the show as the riddler batman and robin had about as many good qualities as a barrel of toxic waste personally i do not know why they had to have batman val kilmer going through therapy remove that and he still would have been a cool superhero with neat gadgets tommy lee jones was not bad as two face nicole kidman and chris o donnell as dr chase meridian and robin respectively did not really add anything overall the point is that when joel schumacher took over directing the franchise went downhill part of the problem was that while tim burton created an eerie gotham city that looked like new york in the 1940s joel schumacher created a gotham city that looked like it was trying too hard to be blade runner so the franchise starting getting stale with this one but jim carrey kept the movie from being unwatchable as edward nygma one of bruce wayne s employees he had some great lines in the movie nygma proposes a device that rests atop tv sets and reads peoples minds but wayne rejects it considering it too dangerous thus nygma becomes the riddler and he is the best character in the movie,negative
this is hands down the worst film ever made in the history of the existence of the universe there have been some bad films made but this is a travesty it is hard to believe that money was spent to make this it could have been used on something else charity i suppose i was 12 when i went to see this and it broke my heart batman was my favorite comic book and character when i was a kid and this film broke my spirit the excellence of the tim burton michael keaton films are long gone the dark emotional center and development of the hero and the villains is sidelined for action sequences action sequences and some more action sequences some of them incorporating the worst cgi and model work ever seen on film the casting itself had to the potential to make a good film george clooney could have made a great batman square jawed popular with the ladies the only thing going against him being that can be too laid back maybe with a better script he could do the darker material uma thurman is perfect for poison ivy she is a good looking yet quirky actress but you would not know it by the emphasis on camp context and innuendo in this film arnie is maybe a little miscast as mr freeze but he does well getting a chance to use some great puns but someone who can come across as more evil would have been better then there is chris o donnell and alicia silverstone as robin and batgirl let us just say more charisma can come from a line of fridge freezers with nothing in them the only decent performance comes from michael gough as alfred only one of two actors to have appeared in all four films his performance is wonderful in this otherwise mess of a film the blame for this disaster can be laid at the hands of joel schumacher his direction misplaced and his intentions misguided he may have redeemed himself with phone booth but he will always be the man who destroyed batman in my eyes,positive
strangely enough that is one ice related pun that mr freeze does not use in this film though it does adequately describe the movie what was i thinking watching batman robin for a third time even worse what was i doing actually starting to enjoy it yes there is something endearingly awful about a film that fails on almost every technical level but it was not always so the first two films in the franchise anchored by the strong and much undervalued lead of michael keaton were enjoyable pop art excursions by tim burton the first still by far the best allowed jack nicholson to ham it up amongst retro stylings and the music of prince the second batman returns was a less successful effort to homage german expressionist cinema the darkest of the four films and struggled slightly under the weight of three villains the lesson was not learnt and the usage of multiple baddies has been a fixed staple ever since with the third batman forever the flat acting of new bat val kilmer was coupled with joel schumacher s garish direction and chris o donnell s irritating robin akiva goldsman was now the writer and any sense of depth had given way to trite puns and disjointed set pieces and so it was that everything that was symptomatically flawed with the series was expanded upon and magnified for the fourth and by far the weakest instalment george clooney has accepted a lot of the blame for this film a humble admission but unfair while he is clearly miscast as both batman and bruce wayne he does not give a bad performance per se rather it is his back up that let us the side down uma thurman am i the only one who does not think she is that good looking has a great time overdoing it as poison ivy but she is joined by arnold schwarzenegger as mr freeze schwarz not exactly known for his acting skill is unrecognisable under his costume so what is the point he gets to call batman batunbuuurg refers to robin as buuurd bouy and only has 100 lines in total the fact that 26 of these lines are lame puns on the word ice that even a two year old would struggle to find funny is even more deplorable and when you hear freeze tell batman yew arr not zending mee too da cooola the urge to use the video s stop button is almost insurmountable bane makes up the trio a monosyllabic muscleman in a gimp mask a completely unnecessary addition he offers nothing to the plot and goes largely forgotten the introduction of wonky mouthed alicia silverstone as a fatuous batgirl character is also grating and why does not her costume come fitted with batnipples like the rest tiny traces of amusement can be gleaned from ivy s dialogue with her urges that her garden needs tending adding some form of adult tone to the humour however it is unrelenting innuendo i will help you grab your rocks does start to wear thin very quickly i did smile at batman s cashcard i never leave the cave without it and it is also nice to see some small references from other films even if it is just a glimpse of the riddler s costume from forever some guards paraphrasing cobra or some street bystanders dressed as clockwork orange droogs in fact the idea of a batman film as completely ott comedy send up may have worked were the rest of the humour more sophisticated it is the hockey team from hell so this is where you hang out i will cancel the pizza oh how lame and functional the dialogue is the film wraps up with a rather pathetic plot contrivance and george having to dish out bland platitudes not all heroes wear masks to give life that is true power oh it really is abominably bad batman robin exists as a classic example of the hollywood system folding in under its own weight however the universal slating this one got neglects one factor while the least successful it still made over 230 000 000 at the box office i wonder how many people would be satisfied with failures like that,positive
well i just had the good fortune to see this movie on the big screen in glorious 3d although my 3d glasses kept falling off of my regular glasses and must say that all of the previous posts with exception of the person who gave it like 9 stars just did not get this movie and never will yes it is bad terribly bad yes the acting sucks etc did this detract from my enjoyment of the film not a whit i can imagine that in 2d on a tv the charm could be significantly diminished but in its original 3d glory this is not to b missed i can not fathom all of the bad posts from folks who claim to like this genre of movies i mean look at the godzilla movies that were coming out at this time frame pure cheese yet i love them just the same if your idea of a giant monster movie is the hollywood godzilla or the peter jackson king kong then by all means please skip this if on the other hand you wish peter jackson would take his next million dollars and sink it into a remake of meet the feebles then you might get a few chuckles out of this movie,negative
the first time i watched this i was so tired at the time nothing made sense this movie was no exception i did not even get the chance to finish it i guess i just fell asleep well i watched it again last night and it still does not make sense none at all it is just far too badly done there are too many mistakes to list so i will not even attempt to all i want to know is if the film makers were serious when they made this movie because if they were i pity them i could make a better movie and look at me i am only 16 ayy yay yay yay one out of many things that really bothered me in this movie was the monster now i got over the whole fact that it is blatantly a man in a monkey suit but some of the things that stuck around and i could not get out of my head were the fact that 1 the ape flipped off the camera what last time i checked apes do not intentionally flip off cameras or anybody else for that matter 2 at one point when the ape was stomping a village by a mountain the ape was wearing high top tennis shoes tennis shoes no i am sorry mr film director apes do not wear tennis shoes please if you are going to make a movie and it involves the portrayal of a wild animal with a human in an animal suit remember wild animals do not wear clothing that is just a little fact of life of which everyone needs to be aware this was a terrible movie but not too terrible in a bad way it was more terrible in a good funny way it was fun to watch it was easy to make fun of it was an experience to remember movies can not be made this bad on purpose they are accidents terrible terrible accidents accidents like 3 mile island or the jimmy carter election they are accidents that should have been prevented through careful evaluation of all people claiming to be film makers please if you ever hear of a movie like this ever being made again take a bat and start beating in the head of the director then take a lighter and some gasoline and burn down the studio then go get a paper shredder and shred the film then take the remaining shreds and toss them into the fire at the movie studio nothing this bad should ever exist again good day,positive
given that birdemic has been blasted by many critics i think i should say something positive about it to start off with the scenery of half moon bay is agreeable for one thing and ms moore has at least a modicum of charisma also anyone who appreciates a stylish blue hybrid mustang rolling along in a stately manner gets to savor that very sight in many lingering shots all positive aspects of this film less positive aspects of this film are legion so much so that i am reminded of my wish that imdb com would allow a vote on a scale from 1 to 100 rather than 1 to 10 in which case birdemic would rate at least a 3 out of 100 for the reasons mentioned and perhaps a 4 for meaning well though the message about global warming comes across in a preachy and ham handed manner still something about the profoundly amateurish quality of this film makes it feel a little unfair to rate it at all in much the same way that it would feel wrong to grade a term paper on the basis of some rough notes jotted down before writing the paper rather than the paper itself this film very much reminds me of a rough draft a sort of rough visualization of what the film would have been if the producer had more resources at his disposal thus making the upcoming larger budget sequel all the more intriguing yet i wonder if this film might have been less entertaining if it were better made if it featured better sound editing writing acting direction and special effects it might just be a forgettable homage to the birds its very flaws elevate or should i say depress it to a special level otherwise occupied by a few special films like the room and manos the hands of fate the legendary realm of films that are so bad they are good so giving it the benefit of the doubt as a real film and not just a rough draft i tender my vote of 1 out of 10 and hope that other fans of this film will also give it an appropriately low vote and insure its rightful place on the bottom 100 once it gathers the requisite number of votes,positive
first of all to approach birdemic shock and terror with any kind of hope of witnessing a good feature film is utter lunacy amateur is a word a thousand times too generous for this film s description even given its low budget of 10 000 the majority of which seems to have gone on car fuel the film is a joke the acting is unspeakably bad the special effects are not worth mentioning the music is corny and inappropriate and the film s editing techniques have all the marvel of a flip book the only way to enjoy this film is to treat it as exactly that a joke the above faults of the film are so glaring that the film becomes one huge joke that you can laugh along to however even this joke wears thin pretty quickly and you are left feeling quite empty as if you have been cheated out of 95 minutes of your life nonetheless i am firmly convinced that it is the director james nguyen who is having the last laugh as he has created a film so notoriously bad that everyone wants to see it perhaps the joke is on us and the director s intention was to see just how popular this film could be through its infamy even so absolutely nothing can forgive how bad this film really is it makes battlefield earth feel like star wars and makes the special effects of 1933 s king kong look like those of avatar it is quite simply the worst film ever committed to celluloid watching the trailer i actually had a decent laugh and thought it might be worth it but having watched the finished product the knowledge that somebody spent 10 000 making this ugly piece of garbage and then having the audacity to call it a film is infuriating and actually quite offensive people were paid to produce this with money i still do not believe it,negative
this is ed wood s masterpiece one literally has to experience this film to understand how nuts it truly is the film literally makes no sense whatsoever and that is the brilliance of it the story of the transvestite glen glenda is told by not 1 but count them 2 yes 2 narrators one of whom was the sad pathetic drug addled bela lugosi watching him rambling almost incoherently bevare bevare it is hard to imagine just 20 years before he was the toast of broadway as dracula just watching him spouting his mindless chatter gives the film a surreal quality obviously this was the biography of wood himself and watching him take the angora sweater from his confused yet loving fiancee is priceless this movie takes camp to a whole level of it is own no other film not even plan 9 from outer space can touch it one watches it in utter amazement,negative
shine on you crazy d wood forget plan 9 this is the benchmark for so bad its good filmmaking a favourite of david lynch s as well as mine this is wood s most sincere and personal effort as well as his most surreal part informative documentary part exploitation part wtf extravaganza love it,positive
i love animation anime and have done since a very early age space thunder kids is not the worst animated movie i have seen but it is laughably bad and you like i sort of did might find some entertainment value in its awfulness the animation has a dull and unfinished quality to it the backgrounds are often static with the galactic backgrounds not doing anything for me and the colours are flat the character designs fare worse they are stiff and forced and the dubbing is rarely in sync with the lip movements actually i think the lip movements were nearly always ahead of the speaking also in the beginning alone there are objects that float around aimlessly and when they are hit with laser beams they pop in very slow motion more reminiscent of balloons that take a long time to pop the music when it appears was not so bad in its orchestration at the time it is just that afterwards it was very forgettable and there are times in the movie where you felt it could have had less music or that a scene did not need any music the characters i was mostly indifferent to the dark emperor was intriguing by name but you do not know much about him while the lead characters are annoying the voice acting dubbing is very poor and sloppy with the actors sounding as though they are not putting any effort in the story is another major problem it is a very unoriginal and thin one i liked the idea somewhat do not get me wrong but that idea was completely abandoned halfway through not only that the film feels as though it has three different beginnings three beginnings that feel disjointed and do not do much to move the story forward or set the tone of the story the film is only a little over 80 minutes but because the pace is so sluggish in places it feels longer and i must not forget the writing it is dreadfully cheesy however i found it impossible not to be amused not because the dialogue was hilarious or anything but because the lines and delivery of them were so bad in conclusion dreadful but had some novelty value 1 10 bethany cox,positive
if you are reading this you too we are drawn here to imbd to ask of the universe what we all want to know those of us who have seen this movie was that even real what did i just watch what happened that this movie exists was god watching when man in his arrogance foisted this magnificent catastrophe into reality just what if you are here reading this review and by some inconceivable trick of fate you have not seen this movie do yourself a favor watch it revel in it savor the bad because baby that is all she has it is worth every excruciating minute i have to respectfully disagree with the reviewer who left 5 stars this film is that bad it is possibly the benchmark for bad itself did minos pause before condemning his deformed son to prowl the labyrinth forever shamed forever reviled did he pause to ask himself what horror have i unleashed how great will be my name for this thing i have done if he did so must have the creators of space thunder kids do not watch this alone it might be my very favorite movie 1 10,negative
i am confirming it is lame it suffers from the same issues as the 1994 fantastic four but unlike ff i can give it a it is so bad it is good stamp and i am very happy about that captain america is a pretty easy comic to adapt to the big screen it is just an action adventure war movie about a guy who sometimes wears a mask they did take some liberties with the character that make my fanboy radar point up but it is superficial steve rodgers is now a boy from southern california who has polio and offered himself up to the super soldier experiment headed up by a woman who escaped from the nazis the idea of a woman creating the star spangled avenger was cool not enough female brainiacs in the comic book industry shortly after steve rodgers becomes captain america the doctor is killed making steve and the red skull the only one s like them after stopping the red skull from destroying the white house he is trapped in ice for 60 years and wakes up having to stop the red skull who has formed an underground crime unit that basically is hydra without saying it again proving how well cap works as an action movie matt salinger who plays steve rogers wearing some sort of padding to make it look like he is got more than he does barely wears the cartoonish suit they made for him of course wearing the uniform makes him captain america duh it is got that 80s swagger to it the red skull has his daughter do all the heavy lifting for most of the movie with her small army of rich nazi brats who drive the fastest cars and wear the hottest fashions but more than capable with the guns they took some liberties with the red skull s origin too i think this was to save money and film the entire movie in italy i am also guessing that certain places in italy look more like southern california than new york city i am being harsh on the movie because i have grown to like the character more now than i ever did when i was a kid and saw this but like i expressed before the movie does have a so bad it is food quality that makes it real enjoyable http cinemagardens com,positive
superhero movies are again a hot property thanks to the big screen adaptations of spider man x men and superman as such many film buffs who know little or nothing about captain america have no doubt been picking this one up at the video store too bad nothing but pure crapulescence awaits them where to begin the movie has a dim look to it the acting is second rate and the action and battle scenes are few and far between it will disappoint most die hard comic book fans perhaps as much as those silly 1970s cap films were on a positive note the action scenes are not awful when the viewer finally gets to them as well the characters stay pretty true to their illustrated roots and kids are not going to be nearly as fussy as adult moviegoers about this one,negative
the only way to describe this roger corman produced flick is to compare it to an episode of power rangers or vr troopers on a 1million budget it is fast paced and fun over the top and cheesy and its short comings are there for everyone to see in all honesty the cast make the most of what they are given alex hyde white has just the right dryness for the part of reed richards and rebbeca staab is quite fitting as sue storm the other characters are less well represented with dr doom being the worst offender over acting as he does through the heavily cheap body armour the realisation of the thing and the human torch is quite good the things full body costume is similar to those used in the turtles movies and the torch is brought to life via some slick animation oley sassone actually gets the best out of the action scenes and coaxes a good atmosphere this is a movie worth seeing it manages to capture a little of the heart of marvel comics in ways that captain america 1991 and the punisher 1989 were not able to it is a petty that more money could not have been made available because as a representation of the f4 it is not bad at all do not get me wrong its no superman the movie and this years fantastic four movie will rock but the film is no plan 9 or gigli either and is worth seeing at least once,positive
i went in expecting cheese i went in expecting something similiar to the 1990 captain america or even the 1970 s spiderman but what i got was something altogether different this origin story fantastic four movie cost 1 million dollars to make which back in 1994 made it a high budget film the fact it is not well known and considered mainstream is because it is so bad it is been brushed under the carpet with embarassing special effects a cast who simply can not be bothered and some ridiculous over the top performances soundtrack the whole thing is truly abyssmal i do not know what it is with the fantastic four but cinematically they just can not get a break maybe when they finally get added to the marvel universe they will have their day but for now i think the 2005 movie is the best one going the fantastic four is like batman forever 1995 made by kindergarteners starring mcdonalds workers the good erm well there is that part that errr i got nothing the bad stupidly over the top in places some major differences from the comic all looks so very dreadful is simply seven shades of terrible things i learnt from this movie a blind person can fall in love with a man she is never seen nor even really spoken to the fantastic four are doomed to never have a great movie,negative
verily if someone would ask me the question what is the thing that you hate the most this movie should be the answer this movie is why turkish movie sector is way back from other countries all along the movie you will not see a sign of the director creating something anything that is actually the idea of anyone turkish i am ashamed that such a movie was shot copy pasted actually others might look into this movie as a joke but i think it is as serious as the assassination of kennedy i guess that hits the spot this is the embodiment of all those wasted years of turkish movie sector i mean come on turkish star wars it is the star wars i pity the time i wasted watching this movie i will kill myself if i hear its name just one more time it is an affront to every movie i love,negative
this film is the most absurd film of the century because of this it must be in the literatures you can really laugh very much but the strange thing this film is not made for this purpose cuneyt arkin is the hero and he is very famous in turkey he has many historical films like this,negative
shaw brothers is mostly known for their kung fu films but they did occasionally try things outside of their wheelhouse namely mighty peking man and super infra man super inframan is your basic rubber suit monster battle but filtered through the lense of hong kong kung fu flicks complete with bad audio syncing and out of place sounding impact shots in terms of plot image if you had an entire seasons worth of power rangers plots squished into 90 minutes and compressed the storytelling into about 20 minutes filling the rest with action scenes the movie is non stop action and unapologetically silly and if you are a fan of silly monster movies or kung fu flicks you will find something to like just do not expect much of a coherent narrative,negative
you really need to know what you are in for before watching this film a 70s children morning show a chinese ultraman explosions the movie it is very campy very cheesy the costumes are pretty bad and laughed a lot throughout the film there were so many crazy things with it that really did not make any sense and yet the film just moved on with it for some reason the big bad knew the guy s name that they kidnapped they knew about the professor as if they had met before and everyone played it with straight faces i was never bored watching this film it was like they squeezed a full season of villains to this superhero into one film so much fighting so many explosions such sharp cone bras it is not for everyone but if you want to see an alternative of what a superhero film from the 70s could look like you really need to give this one a try haha,negative
some awesome stop motion animation in a bad film the only good live action in this movie in every scene eddie dezen is in he plays a real dork in this movie so he is funny the aliens in the movie on the other hand are fabulous they were designed by david allen batteries not included and jon berg star wars they were animated by randall wiliam cook the gate and david allen with all of this talent on board these aliens are truly majestic and awesome stop motion animation fans need to check this one out for the aliens i love them the movie however is a drag 4 out of 10,positive
i was expecting laserblast to be awful judging by its position in the mystery science theater 3000 10 worst movies they riffed list and its reputation it is a bad movie though i can see why people would find it entertaining to watch but it is much better than the likes of monster a go go manos the hands of fate the wild world of batwoman merlin s shop of mystical wonders and hobgoblins and in general there are far worse as well the best asset of laserblast is the music score which pulsates through the movie with great energy and atmosphere that is not matched with the rest of the movie cheryl smith is sweet and sympathetic and keenan wynn is appropriately gruff and i personally though the stop motion and the aliens were quite good of any of the movies on the 10 movies they riffed list it is laserblast that has the best special effects everything else comes up painfully short though roddy macdowell is wasted to the point that you question why was he even in it and eddie deezen has to be the most annoying bully ever seen in film the story is a real drag as well it makes very little sense if at all has so much overlong filler that adds nothing to the storytelling and is one of those instances where the plot summary pretty much sums up the whole movie it also does not know what to do with itself and takes forever to get going it is half an hour until anything of the sort happens and then when the gun is found the rest of the movie is just stuff getting shot at at best the camera work and editing are haphazard the dialogue is hysterically bad and the characters are not developed anywhere near enough or characterised very effectively to be believable or likewise in conclusion laserblast is a bad movie that is rather dull and senseless and wastes mcdowell but a great score better than average stop motion and effects and two decent performances make it not as bad as all that 3 10 bethany cox,negative
troll 2 is a movie so bad it got famous for being it and i will always love it troll 2 is not the sequel to troll from 1986 the original name for the movie was goblin it is not any trolls in the whole movie only goblins that makes the movie even better because how stupid it is grandpa seth is one favourite character ever in movie history he is like a superhero his superpower is that he can not die he just comes as a ghost so if you want to see the best movie of all time watch this but overall it was a masterpiece,positive
you often hear of movies that are so bad that they are good it is hard to point to a single movie that is like this though what some may say is so good it is bad may come off to others as just plain bad however everyone i have talked to who has seen this movie has agreed troll 2 is so horribly shamelessly bad that it is good the writing for film is more than awkward take the redundant stonehenge magic stone and the character dialogue sounds so incredibly unnatural they might as well be robots the reason for this is because the man who wrote the script and directed it claudio fragasso is a native speaker of italian he wrote the script in english when english was barely his second language the acting is absolutely terrible but who can blame them this was most likely the first and last film any of these actors have been in the costumes and special effects have that wonderful b movie quality to them while there are many blaringly obvious errors i find that the smaller ones are actually funnier actors shaking when time is supposed to be frozen or flies on their face during the climatic scenes there are so many continuity mistakes that i sometimes found myself wondering if the director was putting them in on purpose it was like every time the camera shot changed the crew completely forgot how the previous shot was set up and had the actors give their best guess on where they are supposed to be i think everyone needs to see at least a few horrible movies in their lifetime troll 2 is entertaining and hilarious especially when watched with friends the plot is ludicrous but at least you never know what is going to happen next many scenes seem completely unnecessary and this film simply does not bother to justify any of the things that happen in it the end result is a horror b movie that ends up being so horrible that you can not help but laugh the only question i find myself asking now is do i give it a 1 because it was so bad or a 10 because it was so good,positive
they say lightening does not strike twice but check out crawlers this film is produced by the people who brought you that masterpiece known as troll 2 honestly this film does not match the pure genius of troll 2 but it sure comes close first check out the alaskan setting everyone knows that alaska is beautiful and scenic but who knew it was so freaking hot that alaskan summer will kill you at least five characters complain about the ungodly alaskan heat second the boss at the nuclear power plant might be the greatest actor i have ever seen on film his tone of voice never changes its an amazing feat of line reading and i do mean line reading this man deserved an award for this performance no one can be that horrible i believe its a commentary on the robotic nature of our everyday lives this man deserves our respect third look out for those flying roots tremendous special effects work permeates this film check out that helicopter crash was that a fisher price model i do believe it was and how about the tonka truck bulldozer i guess they only had enough money to rent the real deal for a very brief time all in all this film is not quite as good as troll 2 but it come pretty close watch and learn about the true art of filmmaking,positive
well i would not go out of my way for this one its a nice idea but damn its so cheesy i really do not know what more to say its a typical exploitation movie in many ways seriously low budget very poor acting all around its fun i saw someone review say that it was being offered as a pay per view dear god nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo if you see it on the horror channel or something take a chance its harmless fun is there anything good i can say about the film yes a very predictable but good twist ending just like troll 2 you would not be missing out in this sequel if you can even call it that it has nothing to do with its predecessors not even under its many other names but if you want cheese worth a shot,negative
well i thought i had seen bad movies before but this one is the worst by far no plot overweight and drag queen like hero cheap plastic monsters and effects new york accents on all of the characters can you really get any worse even the background music is ridiculous often sounding japanese then techno then just non descript and drowning out the dialogue actually the music drowning out the awful dialogue is probably the best thing to say about this movie and just when you think the movie hits bottom it never fails to disappoint you in reaching yet further into poor cheap effects i am truly at a loss for words,negative
the cream of the crap this movie was literally the worst i have ever seen everything was wrong plot acting music costumes special effects script the list goes on extensively every film making mistake imaginable was made in this film yet i loved every minute of it its hard to imagine it as being a legitimate effort at making a motion picture but as far as i know it was not intended to be humorous a movie so terribly bad that it becomes so wonderfully good i would recommend it to anyone looking for a good laugh i am actually considering purchasing it that is if i can find it anywhere i doubt it,negative
this bad lad turned up on prime and brought me way back to enternia could not believe it is a 5 4 this movie is pure gold the soundtrack is awesome dolph is dolph like in every movie lubic should have been in the movie more would have been an 8 if that was the case the movie bombed due to the budget i had this bad lad on vhs and watched it well over a 100 times it is there with the goodies killer klowns big trouble in little china you either love the full on 80s flicks that age great in time or you bring it down some great memories here and most important it is a good movie even in may 2024 forget the 5 it is a 7 you have the power,positive
i have the power for those of us who grew up in the 80 s that phrase is all too familiar especially for those who would rush home after school to watch our favorite strongman face off against the forces of evil that threaten the safety and security of his homeworld for my money it was never better than when he man faced off against skeletor for the struggle for eternia i also remember the fantasies that i and my friends would have of traveling away to that world of magic and fantasy to fight alongside he man as he defends grayskull it truly was a series that was out of this world and now it is on earth when i first heard about a live action movie mind you i was twelve at the time i was overly excited about it but i did not get to see it until my late teens and i must say that it was very well done especially in its presentation in fact it brought back those far away childhood memories of those late afternoons in front of the tv or outside with the toys a make shift eternia setting with my friends i will grant a few things that were wrong with the movie though there were times that i think the script was either badly edited or just too rushed at certain points i am also not thrilled about them being on earth but understanding budget constraints and the idea to make these characters more real than fantasy help feed into that decision so i let that one go i would have also liked to see more of the characters from the toys in the movie but have no complaints that they made up a few cool characters like blade the casting choices i felt were really good dolph lundgren worked as he man even though he can not act he looked the part and even pulled off the role i could tell that he was not walking through the part as many actor will do with character roles right mr clooney and frank langella the perfect choice for skeletor langella managed to bring that character to life in a way that gave me chills skeletor is perhaps one of the greatest villains ever imagined but the cartoon made him a cackling villain who was more a buffoon than anything therefore he did not seem threatening but seeing langella make skeletor more dark and evil put my faith back into the conviction as a great villain you do not have to be a die hard fan of the series to enjoy the movie it is great fun imaginative and it captures a moment in time do not scrutinize the movie because it is different from the cartoon look at it for what it is and do not focus on its faults it had the power to recapture my imagination so its not all that bad,positive
this movie was mildly mildly entertaining mainly because you keep thinking it is bound to get better it does not but you keep thinking it must basically it is about a woman who gets married to a man who is first wife died tragically as time passes she begins to suspect that she is being haunted by the woman while this film has some creepy moments most of it is pretty boring and nothing is really scary most of you will also be able to see the ending long before it comes still it is not a ridiculously terrible movie and i am sure i have seen the main character before somewhere though i am too lazy to actually look up her actor profile,negative
when you have a disembodied skull an empty mansion a schizophrenic wife a scheming cad and a nutzo gardener throw in a minister and his wife what have you got aip s answer to insomnia the screaming skull gets points for audacity offering free caskets for anyone who dies of fright from watching the film pretty safe bet when you are lulled into a stupor by people who think they are in a production of suspense for dummies but peggy webber was a cutie anyway she had a few good moments of acting here and there especially when trying to communicate with the gardener and no one else fills a nightgown like she but that scared face she makes scary in itself whoa as a whole though there is little suspense here and everything is telegraphed like a punch thrown by a mime you can not be scared by this film it is impossible it has its moments but not enough of them however thanks to a certain mike nelson and his two robot pals there are several moments of pure joy especially in the copy they got hold of the film jumped and it was really scary one star for the screaming skull eight and a half for the mst3k version talk about a screaming bore,negative
i have been a big fan of mk since the beginning although i must admit i lost interest in the game series after part iii buying mk deception this past christmas renewed my interest in the series this movie was crap and i can not believe i bought this mess good thing i found it for 9 99 at the used bin so i was not out of much i was expecting to see a real sequel to the first movie which i found fairly entertaining i thought the first film was very good and does the game upon which it is based some justice not the case with mka the first problem is that they tried to fuse too much of mk2 with mk3 then if you are going to replace a character with another actor christopher lambert then at least make sure the new actor does a batter job than the first the first raiden was a hard ass and you knew not to mess with him the second raiden was a wuss and every time we saw him he was going through a wall weak portrayals of major mk characters was another flaw the actress who portrayed sonya blade was nowhere near as good as bridgette wilson the first sonya same could be said with cage linden ashby what was the point of even having ermac and rain in the movie if they were not going to be referred to a very weak portrayal of sindel kitana s mother and the actress who played her is not fit to act in soap operas line example kitana my mother is dead sindel as will be her daughter gimmie a break stick with the first,negative
i have been a huge fan of the mk videogames practically since the beginning and i really enjoyed the first mortal kombat movie it was not a work of art but it was fun funny colorful and had some great fight scenes anihilation though suffers from an extreme case of sequelitis with about half of the characters re cast all of which were a step down a dumb story line wooden acting effects that were less advanced than the ones in the first movie and a feeling of blah pervading the whole thing perhaps the worst thing is the fight at the end with the two really bad cg animalities a cheesy idea from the game that should have stayed in the game liu kang s dragon looked like a pear with wings and a tail definitely avoid this one if you wish to keep your glowing memories of the arcade game intact,positive
you do not have to be brilliant to know that it is much easier to make a bad movie than a good one you also do not have to be a genius to see that sometimes bad movies are just more entertaining scientist and his wife are having a strange weekend what with aliens dropping in for dinner along with a half animal woman an evil scientist a rubber mutant from space and a very crabby skeleton the lost skeleton of cadavra is a sharp witted send up of all those wonderfully cheesy horror sci fi flicks of the 50 s this spoof has all the elements lame fx a silly plot corny dialog wooden acting heck it is even shot in black and white what really makes this movie great though is just how much unexpected humor erupts from all of this the actions of the aliens attempting to act human the laughably awful voice over for the lost skeleton and of course animala s antics yet at the same time the movie never goes over board with its jokes a great spoof all the way with plenty of finely tuned comedy and more catch phrases than you can imagine the lost skeleton of cadavra is a heart felt tribute to the films that are so bad they are good 1 2 out of,positive
i often get kidded for my choice of monster movies zombies of mora tora terrors of spider island queen of the zombies etc so i like schlock there is the nostalgia i feel when i see the movies i used to take seriously as an adolescent i used to think batman was a drama too i enjoy watching them today with like minded people we make fun of them and have a great time doing it but this movie contained none of the nostalgia that i was accustomed to mostly because it was made in 2001 not 1961 it also just plain did not work its like they tried to make a stupid movie they succeeded it was so stupid i could not watch it the other types of movies i mentioned worked because they were made as serious movies at least for kids and adults get a kick out of watching because of all the mistakes in them this piece of schlock is one scene of deliberate moronic humor after another for example the constant references to science and scientists are a way to get us to laugh at an intentional mistake sorry the repetition is exhausting after awhile anyway lost skeletons of cadavra could have been a good spoof on 1950 s monster movies but it was a huge disappointment,negative
a daring expedition constituted by professor challenger claude rains a scientific richard haydn an adventurer named rolston michael wilding a journalist david hedison an explorer fernando lamas the magnate s daughter jill st john among others journey to remote location where are roaming prehistoric dinosaurs and savage cannibal tribes still alive they confront against the nature s most fearsome predators that savagely stalking its prey it is an amusing old fashioned and dated adventure from arthur conan doyle sherlock holmes s author novel that follows the wake of journey of the center of the earth by henry levin previously filmed in fact the finale part into the cave is similarly realized including a cliff hungers scenes where the protagonists are dangling over a dangerous cliffs pursued by a cruel natives an ambitious production values and quite entertaining considering its age the jurassik creatures are made by transparency as a giant spider and a lizards increased by optics effects the story was impressive when first released but it looks pretty silly for standards nowadays dinosaurs delivers the goods with chills grisly screams when the beasts appear thus the climax film happens when the giant lizards running amok and are fighting among them the motion picture is regularly directed by irwin allen the catastrophe cinema s creator adventure poseidon towering inferno swarm this story was formerly adapted in a silent movie 1925 and with dinosaurs made by the great willis o brien king kong anothers remakes are filmed in 1993 by timothy bond with john rhys davies and of course the especial adaptation by steven spielberg the lost world jurassik park the flick will like to the juvenile public and and adventures movie fans but best enjoyed in big screen,positive
you would expect much more from an irwin allen film than 1960 s the lost world delivers this film is high on silly to obnoxious characters and corniness the first few scenes in the film are particularly loaded down by corniness as we are introduced to the characters there is eccentric professor challenger claude rains with his silly facial expressions and boisterous but stuffy personality there is lord john roxton michael rennie with his selfish and uncharming personality there is jennifer holmes jill st john who starts out by trying to show the men a woman can also be worthy to take along on an expedition but then becomes a useless timid character who shows no strengths at all the sexist remarks made by some male characters in the beginning become even more obnoxious because jennifer never comes through on showing strength courage or ideas to help her crew members the only strength she really proves is that she can pick out some elegant but inappropriate clothing to wear during the dangerous expedition jennifer has also brought along her silly little poodle named frosty and then there is costa jay novello a wimpy greedy seedy little man throw in fernando lamas as manual gomez the hired helicopter pilot who is also along for a side plot of personal revenge he plots his murder revenge and strums his guitar along the way the natives even let him keep his guitar when the group is captured not too many characters to really care for but there are a few to possibly like such as jennifer s brother david ray stricklyn david actually turns out to be more of a help then originally believed a captured native girl vitina marcus turns out to be one of the better characters in the picture but that is most likely because she has none of the corny lines and characteristics the expedition party s characters have there is also corny drama from a love triangle that forms along the way we all know claude rains phantom of the opera michael rennie the day the earth stood still and others can do fine acting jobs and the acting in this movie is fine it is just most of the characters are so corny at times it should be embarrassing to the stars of the picture the action in the film does not really build to any exciting levels as the crew is menaced by various creatures the dinosaurs are lizards and reptiles with fins and horns applied to their bodies and the giant spider is a rather lame effect especially since it just hangs there and only moves its legs a bit there is an unpleasant scene in which a real lizard fights a real reptile portraying dinosaurs that seems very politically incorrect by today s standards and should have been a no no even back in 1960 irwin allen and 20th century fox could have done much better than this and it is not nearly as good of a film as journey to the center of the earth also from 20th century fox still the lost world may entertain on a saturday afternoon matinee level and it is one of those movies collectors of horror and science fiction films will probably want to add to their 1950 s and 1960 s collections,positive
sherlock holmes is not a good movie by a long shot but in comparison to some of the other movies asylum has churned out it is not that bad either i do agree it does have its problems the film is low budget and some of it does show as some of the production values while not terrible are not great some of the editing could have been better while the film is dully lit and some of the sets locations and costumes are just okay if somewhat uninteresting the dinosaur and dragon are quite good though the film is too short and i think too rushed as well and while it was nice to listen to the soundtrack was forgettable soon after ben syder does do what he can with the iconic detective known as sherlock holmes but i could not help thinking in terms of mannerisms and appearance he was miscast however the direction was decent as was the script which had some nice touches without being entirely exceptional while it does have its holes and quite strange in its feel the story is an interesting one and entertaining enough if you do not think about it too much the villain is enjoyable and there are some good performances from gareth david as a more quiet and composed watson and dominic keating elizabeth arends is lovely and the climax was diverting and much better than i expected overall there is nothing outstanding on display and those who are looking for a faithful adaptation will be disappointed but it is mildly entertaining with some good things if you do not take it too seriously 5 10 bethany cox,positive
this is an astounding terrible movie which obviously had a pretty significant budget to be fair here are some good points effects filming and sets everything else was painful to watch without fast forwarding pointless dialog completely wrong casting for sherlock holmes plot with so many holes discontinuities and absurdities editing if this film was edited at all it would be about 30 min long it has many pointless scenes which add nothing to the story bizarre non sherlock holmes characters like a brother named thorpe who worked with lestrade definitely one of the worse movies i have ever seen and it is not even bad in a good way just tedious and dumb,negative
it is so bad it is almost funny but it is not the sad thing is that i really wanted to see a bad cheesy sci fi movie but it was too horrible to watch the loud eerie sound effects the ridiculous music the bad camera angles the incredible bad acting the green rubber alien who breaths like vader the horrendous dialogue the redneck father that wants to shoot his daughter because she threw a glass of water in his face just stay away from it i made the effort of writing enough of a comment so that it gets saved and protect potential viewers from this crap,negative
appearing like a stranger from a strange land the galaxy invader must have thrown people for a loop back in 85 at a time when slashers were all the rage the pg level thrills and cracked sci fi spills are about the last thing you could expect but lowbrow legend don dohler pulls it off and then some the key to it all is commitment there is a fair amount of overlap between cast and crew and many of both cast and crew cut their teeth on previous dohler pictures which he had been making for a while it all adds up to confidence to actors pinging off each other with dramatic result bold use of shaky effects competent framing poignant message this is a film where all the lunacy can not overpower the fact that these people were not screwing around there is effort here and it shines the plot wraps around an alien crash landing in redneck backwoods territory espied by a couple of mean spirited idiots joe montague and frank custor can you smell the sweat who elect to catch and sell it meanwhile a sky watching professor and his student are on the hunt for the being and joe s wife and daughter are just trying to get away safe from him the film wrong foots the viewer pretty early on man is the aggressor here man the wild beast the title is a misnomer the alien is not any kind of an invader and is actually kind of sympathetic also it has the look of a novelty store riff on the creature from the black lagoon at times it almost feels like a red herring in its own film such is the focus on the nefarious joe with a lesser actor this would not have worked at all but richard ruxton brings a tour de force to the table with a perpetual scowl plastered on his face and twitchy violently irate demeanour he blows gusts of derangement through his every moment of screen time a remarkable gonzoid villain don leifert is slightly lower key but nonetheless palpably loathsome as frank while various dohler relatives and local types bulk out the cast there are a few shootings cool shonky mini explosion effects and powerful spurts of tension this undoubtedly aided by driving synths from norman noplock sadly this is his only credit like i said up top this one is committed and so when it strikes it strikes hard things move at a smart clip and the short runtime feels like a breeze by the time the ending locks in it is a breathless ride and the ending itself is a terrific capper now i would not possibly recommend this to regular cinema fans but as a devotee of low budget science fiction lunacy i thought this a really great time if you are still reading this you might to check it out say i 7 10,positive
brandon lee stars as 007 styled spy or he is a mercenary because the damn song that kept playing called him a mercenary go figure who travels to south africa to rescue a scientist borgnine in an accent that must be heard to be believed from a bunch of goons who want borgnine to turn a diamond into a laser weapon this plot angle certifies the level of credibility we are dealing with brandon lee sure made a lot of bad movies in his day with the overrated rapid fire the mediocre though watchable showdown in little tokyo and of course this movie one can only conclude that the crow really was his best effort actually his hong kong produced movie legacy of rage is supposed to be pretty good i ordered it to review it anyway laser mission is easily the worst from brandon lee but that is not to say it is not entertaining it is in fact ultimately hilarious when laser mission starts we witness men put gas masks on while the credits role and the laser mission theme plays and we meet people at a party when the guy explains the caliber of quality of the diamond the crowd breaks out in hilarious whistling the directing apparently implies that this was filmed with a hand held camera the cheapest type and people are gassed all for a diamond which looks really fake brandon lee then arrives talks to ernest borgnine gets shot with a dart and then wakes up in prison he fights his way out and these action sequences are truly stilted worst of all is the acting from debi monahan the seinfeld chick who got killed right her high pitched squealing along with lee s overly smug presence seriously brandon lee was an appealing actor but not here make for the funniest moments brandon lee also dresses up as a cuban we see two cuban soldiers who are movie s would be comic relief make the same jokes over and over again the funniest part of the movie is the climax where we see brandon lee get shot at by the main bad guy but then run him over with the car however when he gets shot at he is standing outside the car the next shot is edited of the car charging towards him hilarious more unintentional hilarity ensues but hey this movie was only 2 99 and if you are a big time brandon lee fan or a fan of camp this is perfect cheese out of 4 bad,negative
michael gold brandon lee is a mercenary hired by the cia to find a german scientist ernest borgnine the scientist has developed a laser technology that everyone wants after their rendezvous on the beach both brandon and borgnine are captured this sets up the daring escape by brandon after which he volunteers to go back and find the professor this movie is classically bad it seems to take place in africa with soviet cuban and german soldiers involved debi monahan rounds up the cast as the professor s daughter she is thoroughly annoying in this role as her voice seems to increase in pitch as she gets louder and is also very whiny the only redeeming qualities of her character is her push up blue dress which seems to be the only thing she wears during the movie she does wear a white jump suit at the beginning and a bed sheet after the sex scene brandon lee is suppose to be the star of this movie however he comes off quite flat its not just the acting that is bad but also the action i have not seen so many drop kicks since star trek the original series he also tries to emulate his father by doing characterizations see chinese connection the slapping manuel sketch is a good indicator how bad his acting is it is funny though he also seems to pull off an arab beggar to complement brandon other than debi monahan we get mr borgnine whom we see actually sleeping during a scene a crazy soviet colonel who refuses to die a white big game hunter and a pair of bungling cuban soldiers a female sergeant and the beloved manuel nothing sums up this movie more completely than the theme song of the movie mercenary man which seems to be playing in either muzak form or the 80 s bad rock form and the dialog dialog such as brandon i did my job pay me and let me get the hell outta here cia suit kiss my ass brandon no this movie was definitely worth the 4 i spent on it rip brandon celluloid rehab,positive
this film is so bad that it is good my son joe and i have seldom laughed so often during a film even the best comedies from hollywood there are so many unintentionally hilarious scenes that one hardly knows where to begin let us start with lugosi somehow he does not look like your typical long island houseowner his european cape is strangely not in sync with the rest of the community the gravedigger scene is very funny as well how cheap are the people in this community with their loved one s graves a cheap wooden cross instead of a headstone that is pretty cheap but not as cheap as the sets in this film ed wood bless his soul does a masterful job of ruining every scene with horrendous props i love the curtains separating the pilots of an airliner from the passengers that we never see great security remind me not to travel on that airline but this is not the only place with curtains the pilot s home even though he lives outside with his wife has curtains outside the home i have never seen this decor before even the spaceship has curtains the people who made curtains as props for this film made a fortune i think that the price is right must have the director s favorite tv show what is behind curtain number two the cast had two major problems very few of them knew how to drive a car two of them put the cars in reverse before driving two others leave the lights after leaving the car another problem area for both the police and the aliens are their weapons they do not seem to work the aliens are forced to flee when their microwave oven catches fire this is perfectly understandable there is also a very fat man who wanders around looking for food and a scantily dressed woman who does not change her clothes for four days and can be smelled from over 100 yards away this film is not half baked it not even in the oven but it very funny to watch,positive
i am giving this rating to this mess because over time it has found the hearts of so many people how can one really hate the absolute diligence and undying spirit of ed wood this movie has everything silly aliens people rising from the grave vampires ridiculous flying saucers and without a doubt some of the worst acting that has ever been committed to celluloid and still we laugh and look forward to each scene because we know what is next we know that bela passed away and a guy who has no physical resemblance to him had to take over there is no real plot i believe that the worst list is for movies that have no heart something like godzilla vs freddy mercury i believe that there are and were directors who simply wrote for the third feature at drive in movies where the kids did not even watch if you have not seen this film have the fun of viewing it for the first time,positive
i actually enjoyed this movie despite the terrible reviews and the terrible user ratings its plot is fair it is effects are great even for now and the acting although certainly not brilliant is fair enough to work with the plot i would give it a 7 10,positive
this is one of those movies i loved as a thirteen year old i remember seeing it a few times it was a film naturally aimed at my age group in 1993 i wish people would remember that when writing up such serious reviews it is quite a fun story the special effects are probably a little naff thirty years later but what do you expect bob hoskins is good fun i am surprised by just how dark the story is funny how you have a different look on things when you are young what i found interesting was the theme music almost unreal by roxette what an awesome track arguably the best aspect of the film fun 7 10,positive
what should i have expected from a movie that says experience a lesson in real bad taste and expect the worst on the front cover starring an actor called k the butcher shitter and produced by the violent shitters this was the debut of loud mouthed german gore fiend andreas schnaaaaas a director that is renowned for releasing films that would get banned in most countries for their titles alone shot on a camcorder violent shit makes nail gun massacre look like spielberg helmed it in his spare time under a pseudonym seriously this is not a movie at all it is more like an exercise in restraint sitting through the whole eighty minutes is like being locked in a room with peewee herman and not killing him a task that if completed will prove a man s machismo so decidedly that he will be able to walk proud for the rest of his life if you have checked my review list you will see that i am a forgiving fellow i would have to be because i have seen some utter schlock in my life but this wipes the existence of the worst of them from my memory quite how it went on to spawn three sequels is amazing and how the crew behind the production was not imprisoned for some kind of breach of human rights was a further miracle still i have started my review so i may as well tell you what left me so bemused the credits roll over a child playing in some woodland with a ball he goes home and his mother threatens him saying you wait get in here the door closes and we hear a somewhat leisurely scream it looks as if the youngster killed his mum with a meat cleaver because he comes outside splashed in blood with the weapon in his hand two decades later the police or polizei are transferring the demented looking bogeyman to erm well we do not ever learn but thankfully an officer sums it up neatly for us now we have to work overtime to bring these retards back to their holes i could not have put it better myself i must comment on the security which was questionable to say the least i mean is that how they transfer homicidal maniacs in germany in an herby esque camper van without any bars on the windows or dead locks on the door hmmm anyway one of the coppers makes the fatal mistake of giving in to the call of nature and returns to find his buddies bloodily despatched surprisingly off screen i thought the killer we do not find out his name was giving one of them a love bite but i guess he was eating his neck after shouting stop you pig or i will shoot the final lawman meets his bloody end by a patently cardboard machete to the shoulder his demise was undoubtedly his own fault for leaving such a deadly blade inside the van with a nut job in the first place but hey i guess his rampage had to be kicked off somehow without going into the fact that this constabulary s methods for transferring psychopaths certainly needed a complete overhaul let us just say that the butcher ends up roaming the countryside and killing everyone that he bumps into on his journey the plot s is as non existent as anyone could expect it to be he legs it around some greenland with a blade in his hand and a scar on his cheek s offing anyone that bumps into him the first a woman driving along listening to ub40 s red red wine has schnaas been sued or did he buy the rites i very much doubt it breaks down then gets thrown on the floor and her breast cut off after some bizarre camera work involving the photographer spinning the camcorder in circles yes you will get a headache a guy gets his penis chopped in half all these are shot in unflinching close up with paint red blood spraying unconvincingly over the surroundings then an unfortunate vulgar speeched gardener gets cut in half with a hedge trimmer then his head is chopped in two the final excuse for gratuitous gore that i will tell you about although there is plenty more throughout the eighty minute runtime involves a woman getting split in half from the vagina upward then the killer we still did not learn his name disembowels her chucking her intestines liver and every other organ that schnaas could find a close replica for on the floor in front of the camera i am making this sound a whole lot better than it actually is but keep in mind that the acting is no less than ridiculous the music is played separately from the german subtitled in english dialogue what do you expect from a camcorder and the lighting stinks at one point things got all anti religious when the nut job sticks his head in i guess what is supposed to be jesus stomach we do not get an explanation on why there he is the son of god stuck on a crucifix out in the middle of the woods and the ending oh yes the ending what the hell there is loads of pointless padding like endless driving sequences showing cars heading down long boring roads that never amount to anything and there is some x rated dialogue that brings about a giggle i guess we can forgive some of the inconsistencies seeing how this was made tongue in cheek to be consumed in the same manor but to be honest a lot of the pointless exploitation was a little too sickening and not in a good way schnaas really should have started himself a career in special effects putting his clearly visible talents to use with more experienced filmmakers but instead he goes on to make movies like this that will only appeal to gore hounds that are truly forgiving what is left to say about violent shit is it violent yes very but do not forget it is also a steaming pile of you get the picture,positive
although i was a bit hesitant when first watching violent shit i soon found myself absorbed in the henious murders that karl begins comitting about halfway through the film the budget may have been very low and the acting even in german is a joke but the special effects take the cake with this sweet baby not only is there one of the nastiest decapitations in film history but we are also treated to the most gruesome visions of dismemberment splaying castration and torture ever put to film keep the film muted strip yourself of moviemaking standards and sit back violent shit is frighteningly gory fun,negative
werewolves on wheels was one of the first tapes i bought when i got a vcr did it satisfy well it is got violence and nudity sort of and i guess that is what the moviemakers intended and who am i to criticize do not watch this for intellectual stimulation do watch this for gratuitous nudity and pretentious biker type terroristic mannerisms also the intro music is not half bad in fact it is pretty good it deserves a better flick behind it,positive
werewolves on wheels is a cheapo early 70s independent movie that screams shot on a budget some maverick producers had the idea of riding the wave of not one but two 70s film trends the biker flick and the horror movie combining them into an unwieldy and unwelcome concoction to say the least of course with that title this film is irresistible but it is also rather dull horror fans hoping for werewolf action will be disappointed to learn that the werewolf scenes are limited to a couple of brief fights and murders with characters wearing what look like reject masks from an old lon chaney movie for much of the running time this is a straightforward biker flick padded out with some very bad acting and lots scenes of bikers riding down an empty highway in the blazing sunshine while music blares on the soundtrack there are no sympathetic or even interesting characters here the horror feels very lukewarm and lots of scenes are shot in the dark so you can not see what is going on seriously it is not very good,negative
you have not experienced cinematic boredom until you watch this incoherent mess you know you are in trouble early on when the voice over usually the saving grace of hopeless movie directors singularly fail to explain what is going on you the viewer is on your own here completely deserted by monster a go go the actors sit around a lot talk a lot whatever the monster does not really relate to anything else happening here but he does look frighteningly emaciated and wasted and very tall trouble is he does not get much screen time when the ending finally arrives a celebration is in order admire yourself enormously for sitting through this it is an achievement believe me the second worst movie ever manos hands of fate is even worse but not by much,negative
this one is the king of cheese i think mystery science theater 3000 did this one so i am probably the only one who has not seen it personally i can not stand commentary when i am watching a movie when you go to a movie you want to punch the guy who will not stop talking during it then some people pay money to have a guy and some robots talk and crack jokes all through a film makes no sense to me this film however has a radioactive monster running around the city freaking people out this one though takes the cake for all time so bad its good one scene has a man sitting at the desk waiting for a call they have to use a crew member to make the sound of a phone ringing with his mouth you really can not describe how bad this thing is but the opening tune is pretty cool,positive
first off messalina empress of rome is not the original title of this movie and neither is caligula the sins of rome these are both titles given to the original 1977 movie messalina messalina it was re titled for the video market in 1991 and 1994 the very cool thing about this movie is that it features almost all the sets and props used in the 1980 classic caligula caligula was actually shot in 1976 but because of various lawsuits was not released until february 1980 the co producer of caligula franco rossellini decided in early 1977 to use the sets and props left over from caligula and shoot a quickie he cast 2 actresses from caligula anneka di lorenzo and lori wagner for the new movie and then brought in a whole new crew to help out it is true this movie is not the best it is dubbed from the italian it is grainy but it is definatley a fun watch there are some very funny scenes some nice boobies and a bit of a story to keep things interesting you really get to see the caligula sets designed by danilo donati much better than in caligula and that in itself is worth the price of admission for more info check out the official caligula fan site listed on this page cheers,positive
italian comedies from the 1970s can best be compared as a hotchpotch of the carry on films and slapstick ala naked gun fast talking grimacing physical comedy basically it is the old man steps on a rake joke over and over again messalina messalina is not exception from the norm with the exception that the film contains more nudity lots and lots of nudity and the film being all about the empress messalina cheating on her husband emperor claudius the successor of emperor caligula so do not be fooled by the alternative title caligula 2 some of the sex scenes depending on the copy you own trespassing from soft to hardcore among the most popular spaghetti comedies were those featuring bud spencer and terence hill the italian version of laurel and hardy if you so want there is no spencer and no hill in this film both presumably having fought tooth and nail against appearing in a film like messalina messalina instead we get thomas milan and bombolo both go through the routine but it is never more than that routine in addition to the gratious nudity the film features a battle scene which has enough gore and limb hacking to rival the violence of gladiator interesting trivia much of the set and costumes not to mention some of the actors like lori wagner and anneka di lorenzo have been borrowed from the set of bob guccione s caligula so for fans of this notorious epic the film remains worthwhile curiosity with an eerie sense of deja vu in essence the film has very few qualities worth mentioning unless of course you are a fan of flat italian comedy or came here for the nekkid girls 3 10,negative
this movie is not all that bad if you compare it to santa claus conquers the martians it has to be the most colourful movie to be shown on mst3k the director wanted to make a fantasy movie and that is what he did but it is still a bad movie a lot of the movies on the bottom 100 were just made for the money but this one was not this film actually a very expensive to make seeing how it was made in colour so how can a movie that is not that bad end up on lists of worst films ever it still feels like a normal run of the mill christmas movie despite all it is bizarre moments the strangest thing about this film is the inclusion of the devil and the fact that he wants to kill santa and ruin christmas its very much like the grinch in that regard again if you think about it it is not that bad of a movie,positive
this film is awful give me the dentist anytime can you believe that one of the main tv stations here in arabia had this as their christmas film i can only assume they expected to entertain the crowds with dudley moore rather than this the last time i looked at my hot water bottle it had more acting better plot more drama and a lot more interest than this waste of celluloid do not even watch it if you are drunk,positive
i really enjoy this silly little holiday flick a bunch of serious martian adults are afraid that their serious martian children are too serious so they go to a serious martian senior citizen the old guy tells them that the children need to be taught how to laugh and then he explodes for no reason the only logical thing left to do of course is go to earth and kidnap santa claus who we meet as he is being interviewed by the rip taylor like andy anderson i liked how in the movie s universe santa is unquestionably real and everyone knows about him he really does deliver toys to everyone toys made by a dozen elves who all look like they are suffering from mini seasonal depression one toy shown is a toy rocket that runs on real rocket fuel santa proudly explains i would ask where do little kids get rocket fuel the details of santa s amazingly speedy mass distribution methods are not brought up but it is probably black magic related the martians nab kris kringle and two little earth children who seem to live alone in the woods with no parents or family but are clean and well fed the martian leader forces santa and the children to run their soulless toy machine soulless toy machine would be a good name for a band despite the numerous violations of human rights it is all in good fun and everybody is nice and happy except for one mean martian with a disturbing droopy mustache and a sidekick that looks like jamie farr who plots to kidnap santa even though he is already been kidnapped santa encourages the kids even the martian kids who have now learned to have fun to hurl lots of heavy mid sixties toys at the bad guy s skulls through this display of parental negligence and bad music the evil is thwarted and santa is permitted to go back to earth letting the mewling half wit comic relief martian named droppo take over the reigns of the martian toy empire the martians are out of shape guys in tights and helmets with antenna sprouting out of them and what looks like diarrhea smeared across their faces imagine a guy dressed like that mugging worse than the teacher guy in juan piquor simon s monster island and that is droppo how can you hate this movie if i were a little kid in 1964 i would be enthralled they packed this movie with nutty stuff elves get shot with freeze rays mrs claus is a frantic goofball the martian children sleep under strange lights and eat only pills the bad guy s hideout looks like that one king crimson album cover i loved the part where the villain tries to shoot santa and the kids out of an airlock and the part where the bad guys meddle with the toy machine and the toys come out all mixed up there is a guy in a goofy robot costume and a guy in an even goofier polar bear costume and that deliciously idiotic theme song you spell it s a n t a c l a you s hooray for santy claus oh it is so good i sincerely feel the people making this had the best intentions and while they did not have a huge budget they made a fun silly kids movie if it was the same exact movie but done in rudolf style stop motion animation it would be a regular holiday viewing tradition oh yeah and pia zadora is in this as if anyone cares,positive
the title pretty mush somes up what kind of movie we have here that is cheesy dumb and wrong on so many levels in other words the perfect film for mst3k i do not really need to how bad it is but there is only one msytery that eludes me who the hell thought that this might a good enough idea to put money to fund a film like this i can only think of two reasons 1 since it is a holiday film they thought they could get away with it 2 it was made in canada still i love the mst version and can not think of a better film that could serve as their chrismas special also i never noticed prior to watching this that santa is smoking an icon for children everywhere is smoking out of a pipe hilarious,positive
i saw the premiere of this film in edinburgh at the odeon the theatre was packed and having really enjoyed the first movie like i guess most of the audience we were all really excited to be seeing the sequel you can imagine our dissapointment lots of people including us left 20 mins before the end quite a few patrons were quite angry at how ineptly bad it was having recently seen it again on cable it is still utterly woeful i would rather go and clean the toilet than sit thru it again on second thoughts i would rather come and clean your toilet and i do not like clieaning toilets and do not know you get the idea,negative
i have heard alot of bad things about this but being a fan of the highlander film and tv series i had to check this out that was a mistake this movie has almost nothing to do with the first movie and even by itself sits on laughable premises the writing is terrible the characters are one dimensional at best the effects look like they were done out of someone is garage hey let us summon back dead characters for no apparent reason hey let us pretend everyone is from another planet you know what let us through in a conspiracy for the hell of it this movie seems like it did not leave the script writing process until they finished shooting and then they skipped editing i shudder to think the horrors i would have witnessed had i not been watching the directors cut,negative
this movie should have been a project redlight john travolta is out of his head and hopelessly devoted to l ron hubbard that he was able to con 10 other people into investing 80 million towards the making of this movie is the only real impressive angle i can work for this review perhaps travolta wanted to work with tarrantino again and thought the only way that that could happen is if his own career fell into the tank or perhaps he felt it was his duty to make the film in order to get a better seat in dianetics heaven let us hope that tom cruise can learn from barbarino s mistake i do not think it will matter too much to point out everything that is bad about this film but the acting the dialog the special effects the plausibility of the cave people s quick learning development and of course the hair extensions will just have to suffice i would have given the movie a 1 out 10 rating but i did laugh at the movie quite a few times and that should be worth something i think the version i watched was on the usa network and it was modified for teevee so i may have missed some key plot elements that were cut from the original vision of its director but then again i may have seen some really good levitra adds in its place the end credits whizzed by so quickly that it would appear that no one really wanted to have anything to do with this movie except travolta in preparing a judgment of worth i proclaim this lame movie to be worst do not forget that i told ya to blame john travolta and l ron for battlefield earth oh if it were only a musical 2 10 clark richards,negative
not because travolta is in dreds not because of the alleged scientology subliminal messages but because it is one of the worst movies ever made i do not use that term lightly i consider myself a lover of bad movies movies that can be enjoyed for their lack of success battlefield earth goes well beyond that into the realm of slow torturous pain i saw this movie because i expected it to be bad and even i was shocked at how bad it was just plain bad in nearly every respect i suppose i should note that the ear bleeding sound effects sounded pretty realistic and they were loud so the guy who did the sound should not be ashamed everyone else that worked on this movie bow your heads director roger christian has put together one of the worst movies sci fi or otherwise that i have seen loaded with uninteresting characters a dumb plot ridiculous gaping holes in logic terrible direction only so so special effects and a huge length for a movie this bad over two hours battlefield earth is already being compared to plan 9 from outer space in my book it is a fair comparison take the direction sure ed wood had no clue what he was doing but at least he pointed the camera directly at the actors when they talked christian decides he is going to be original and tilt the camera at least 45 degrees everytime someone says anything the whole movie i was tilting my head side to side trying to keep up the effects well plan 9 had pie tins in strings battlefield earth has a couple of nifty cgi effects but the final length battle sequence is filmed in a very dark blue setting rendering it impossible to see who is shooting who at any given moment of course even if i had known it would not have made much of a difference because i really did not care about any of the characters one way or another gaping continuity well plan 9 had scenes in cars that began in the day then turned to night when people got out of the cars in battlefield earth the psychlos can discover gold veins in difficult to reach mountains but somehow totally miss out on fort knox still completely stocked with gold 1 000 years in the future cavemen learn not only to speak and work together but operate harrier jets within a week how did they learn you ask well on a harrier jet flight simulator of course somehow still working on electricity 1 000 years in the future more the cavemen communicate with walkie talkies in the final battle how do they still work they found fresh batteries next duracels i see they better say best if used before 3005 is battlefield earth worse than plan 9 i would have to say yes plan 9 is so cheesy and goofy you have to laugh just fun to watch after about an hour of earth i wanted to hurt someone after two hours and it was still going i wanted to hurt myself avoid even for lovers of dumb movies,negative
all i can think about this horrid piece of crap is oh jesus christ the idea of this movie is a good idea the execution of this film was the worst some say well it is an inside hollywood joke no it is not kid notorious on comedy central is an inside hollywood joke joe ester whosits is an inside hollywood joke that continues to get a paycheck but there is not anything actually wrong with that as we can all see there are many inside hollywood jokes that are getting paychecks while talent is still knocking at the door as i have written the idea of this film was a savvy one it just does not transfer or makes sense in this film we all know who alan smithee is and its kind of funny to see a real alan smithee want to take his make off of a film funny for about 15 seconds then we have a whole nother hour or so of this movie to go of nothing but pure hell masquerading as a hollywood inside joke the guy who writes on bazooka joe bubble gum wrappers would have done this film better much better oscar caliber better okay i went a bit too far on the last better comparison or did i,positive
burn hollywood burn is a terrible movie in every sense of the word and its only redeeming quality is because of an accident that occurred after filming concluded on concept this high brow yet simple movie of mockery is a thing of genius i mean make a movie about a guy named alen smithee whom is losing control of a big budget movie however he can not disavow the movie because he is the fake name he is alen smithee now that is funny but maybe only if you know movie history perhaps it is to high brow because nobody went to see this film or perhaps it is to english ie eric idle as the leading role or perhaps it is just plan terrible the movie basically rather than poking fun at hollywood and the stream of never ending big budget special effect extravaganzas which eric idle s character is making 1 of pokes fun at itself instead it jokes about the movie being made is worse than showgirls bhb is from the writer of showgirls but in reality the movie bhb itself is worse than showgirls the actors just do not have any fun and are not very good they are stuck in the middle of hamming it up and actually acting this is probably because the fake movie is supposed to be bad but instead that badness overflows into the real movie jackie chan sly stallone and whoppie goldberg cameo as overpaid and past their prime actors demanding huge wages and silly concessions and while some aspects are true they do not all apply to the actors jackie chan wanting like red m ms taken out or something anyway the movie turned out to be directed by alan smithee which is almost a saving grace but it had to be the writers cut which survived to get that moniker and not the directors cut the incident occurring after filming wrapped perhaps doing as such was a lame attempt to save a lame movie but this movie about making a bad movie turned out to be just that aka a bad movie,negative
this cinematic masterpiece follows the life of an alien attempting to fit in with his human surroundings the story is told through the aliens perspective and because his species perceives time and events differently than ours some of the events may seem confusing to the viewer at first however once the viewer understands that johnny is simply not from our world you can truly understand the turmoil he s in truly a tribute to modern artistry,positive
okay quality of the movie 0 10 enjoyability of the movie 10 10 total paradox right this is the absolute pinnacle of bad story bad dialogue bad editing bad plot i mean i am saying bad like there actually is any of these elements within the film the editing makes no sense it seems randomly cut with continuity errors there are lines like what is going on with the candles and the music when there are no candles or music the entire thing is absurd but what makes it truly unique is that it was done entirely seriously this is not a tongue in cheek production like low budget bad movies that know they are catering to an audience who expect to laugh at the poor effects and story no this man tommy wuseau honestly genuinely thought he was crafting his magnum opus masterpiece of cinema is it good absolutely definitely not however as a movie experience i watched this with some of my family warning them it was terrible but we had one of the funniest most incredible bonding experiences in cinematic history as we collectively picked apart every camera angle wobbly set insane use of props costume music that skips repeats continuity edits plot and dialogue there is not one redeeming moment in the entire movie even if there is a single well crafted line there is not it would have to be spoken by either a terrible actor or by tommy himself who is accent sounds like it was in a european car crash we all laughed until it hurt and for that i have to give the experience a 10 10 i have never enjoyed a movie more with friends and family more than this one ever i head that the experience is similar in theatres that still show this film for precisely this reason everybody dresses up as their favourite character recites every line and throws spoons at the screen every time one inexplicably ends up on screen it is a lot is there a reason behind this artistic decision no there is no reason for anything there is more and more to notice about this film every time i watch it most recently how the architecture of the building makes no sense whatsoever they appear to be on the ground floor but exiting from the other side causes them to end up on the roof at night it is things like this that could inspire a phd in studying the intricate insanity and entirely non sequitur values of every moment in the room do i recommend it well how can i not everyone needs to see this movie at least once after a couple of drinks and with friends it is even funnier than weekend at bernies after taking magic mushrooms i almost died laughing from a hypoxic brain injury unable to catch my breath narrowly avoiding giggling myself into a coma the finest abdominal workout video ever made,positive
on my list of worst movies ever made there is nothing likable about this movie it is totally worthless noise honestly i can not think of one single redeeming moment the story is stupid the script is trite the characters are 1 dimentional as is the acting i could care less if they lived or died there is nothing special about the effects nor the cinematography nor the score several pointless scenes of mindless ear numbing shoot them up s that neither moved the plot along nor offered any entertainment value whatsoever no one should be subjected to this film ever under any circumstances the only thing this film is really good for is fire kindling,negative
i give this movie a full ten stars due to the hilarity of its directors commentary not because of any quality in the film for there is none when my brother rented house of the dead after his appalled viewing he watched it with the directors commentary to see what the hell the director was thinking and the commentary was better than the movie so now we rent this guy s stuff just to laugh our asses off with his idiotic musings he actually believes that his movies are works of art you will giggle uncontrollably when you watch alone in the dark and any other uwe boll movie with the commentary he refers to his ending as lynchian for a reason that the viewer nor apparently the director can explain he constantly makes fun of tara reid and complains that she does not take off her bra he refers to every shamelessly ripped off scene as an homage best of all he complains that he is a misunderstood genius who has been unfairly criticized on this very site imdb chances are he is reading this review and others at this moment and plotting about how to incorporate his rebuttals into his next commentary track,positive
i have not seen this film in awhile but remember it pretty vividly the film was obviously shot on a really low budget and without any real actors it has a kind of manos feel to it but with nudity and even worse special effects there are bats that are obviously on wires and some pretty cheesy costumes the guy doing dracula s voice sounds like an old jewish man i do not know where the hell they got the idea to make dracula jewish considering he was transylvanian the only thing that i liked about this movie is that it did not take itself seriously at all count dracula is living in an abandoned mine in the middle of nowhere he invites a local reporter to visit him he goes under the pseudonym of alucard hee hee hee like nobody s ever heard that before when the inept reporter gets there dracula turns him into a pretty crappy looking wolf man named irving jackelmann enough with the jewish jokes already dracula then sends him out to catch beautiful girls for him to tie up love up and drain dry dracula takes a hankering for the reporter s girl friend and ends up chasing her around his cave the opening ten minutes have some really awful stream of consciousness speech by the reporter involving the blue mountains behind the blue mountains behind the blue mountains we get it already dracula s accent is just plain annoying irving jackelmann also proves to be pretty bad the chase scene for the love of god was only a nude woman running around the same set for an excruciatingly long time the nudity can not save it and the jokes although trying hard to be campy are just plain dumb avoid unless you can spare a few brain cells,positive
the first 20 or so minutes of this film are really hilarious really funny the dialogue and overdubbing are so beautiful this is the best example of bad dubbing i have ever seen who knows maybe they were doing it on purpose either way the words they chose to use as the script are almost like they did not know the original story and were making it up as it went along telling jokes the whole time and making funny comments about everything that you would not normally hear a character in a movie say they cut on each other and talk about how they have to go to the bathroom and juvenile things like that i doubt it translated much at all from the original after the funny parts at the beginning like the opening monologue about the blue mountains the movie goes downhill and becomes monotonous it is like soft core but it is sort of rude dracula gets these women naked and then insults them because they have small breasts or are too heavy or something usually you have a naked woman on the screen and everyone is excited but dracula is very snooty and picky it is sort of funny but also sort of mean especially since i do not think he was supposed to say those things originally a funny movie because of the new script the best parts are at the beginning the wolf man is very well done dracula is kind of sexy the naked woman are too much for me funny then porny,positive
they say that a film can change your life for some it was citizen kane others schindler s list for me it was ninja the protector from the plot that made no sense to the constant cartwheeling to the poor dubbing even over the english speaking actors and the steady stream of channel 5 heyday soft porn scenes ninja the protector is not only one of the best martial arts cum porno films but one of the greatest films ever made prepare yourself for sex motorcycles shirukens teleportation and the best f cking moustache since moving pictures were committed to celluloid quality personified,negative
once again harry must stop the ninja empire this time by infiltrating a model agency with the help of one of his agents who he does not share screen time with one of the downsides to being in a film cut together from 2 films harrison does rather touchingly keep a photo of his model ninja friend who i think is called warren harrison has honed his martial arts skills to perfection for this film and it has paid off in spades he is great with a blowpipe and his teleportation skills just get better and better i only have two complaints with this film firstly it is quite hard to see harrison in his ninja attire due to the fact it is camoflage material and often harrison vanishes into the background especially during scenes filmed in a park secondly i could not watch the end because it concentrated on warren s relationship with his brother david david s not a handsome chap and seeing him do the nasty with a random wench made my eyes bleed overall though i would give it 9 10 it is the kind of film that makes you want to run up a hill in your pyjamas and shout ninja loudly,positive
this movie is what defines nothing special you watch it you like some parts some you do not and you will never think about it once you leave the theater as a player of the baldurs gate computer game the d d cosmos is nothing new to me but in this movie most of the inherent magic of this fascinating world was simply let out for poor effects and cheap character stereotypes the female mage has nothing to do but to look nice and to scream in moments of danger she hardly ever uses her magic abilities and therefore is a splendid example of the poor role play adaption this movie is she is no mage she is simply a damsel in distress the humor of the movie also is very simple and nothing to really laugh about that is if you leave out jeremy irons incredibly bad acting his bad mage routine should be added to acting books under the chapter how to overplay a character but to be true those were the most funny moments of the movie so at least irons was good for something here all in all a rather unspectacular start to the new wave of fantasy films which will accompany the giant blockbuster lord of the rings production i pray to god that the tolkien adaption will be far better than this mostly trashy b movie,negative
i have been playing or dming a d d for most of my 38 years even before i hit my teens i was writing better scripts for adventures then exist in this movie there are so many plot holes the truck has not been built that is too big to drive through them and despite having a cast of actors that are not all that bad the acting is in most cases similarly dreadful so if you have ever played a d d do yourself a favour and do not watch this movie to avoid all the hair being ripped out of your skull whilst watching if you have never played a d d then still do not watch this movie rent out willow or princess bride or ladyhawke or lord of the rings to get an idea about how good a campaign adventure could be watching this will just put you off ever playing the game,negative
this one kind of is like an earlier movie from 1987 masters of the universe based on the cartoon he man basically you have a great old world and they for some reason have to have nearly all the action of the movie take place on modern earth well i guess it is not so modern earth now and that it is an ancient world now of strangeness and a den of good times gone by well i guess i can figure why they did in fact place nearly all the movie in modern times in this and that movie to save money on costumes and sets it is a lot easier to recreate what is going on in the present than a strange world like that of eternia in he man or an ancient world with cults and strange pyramids sacrifices and strange creatures that hug you to death this movie is forgettable and not very entertaining your first clue that it is not going to be the best movie in the world is that robert z dar is in it the only thing this one has going for it is the animals which are not as prevalent in this one as they were in the last marc singer is back and it is sad to seem him in this state the guy was a fairly good actor reduced to trying to make a sequel to a movie that really did not need one and even if it did it came five years to late,positive
i liked this movie way too much my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside of corse ironside is just a low rent jack nicholson i guess mike was busy that year with highlander 2 the quickening sadly beastmaster 2 would have been a much better career move it is certainly the best of the beastmaster series and in many ways reminiscent of that great big screen classic masters of the universe not only does it star the incomparable mark singer it also features an amazing supporting cast specifically the second girl from sliders uncle phil from fresh prince of belair and evil chick from superman 2 it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets beastmaster forever rock n roll,positive
an american woman named cathy asks her indonesian boyfriend hendra to help her investigate balinese black magic known as leyak leyak is the most powerful black magic there is and she soon begins to pay a terrible cost when she turns into a flying head that feasts on unborn babies i have seen my share of crazy indonesian horror cinema and mystics in bali is perhaps the most known of them all it is based on indonesian mythology and for a supernatural culture largely undiscovered by western movie fans the special effects are incredibly cheesy and inept the dubbed dialogue is absolutely hilarious still there is a flying head which has the body s internal organs trailing behind along with a little foetus eating and an evil sorcerer for all of you fans of indonesian trash the main actress llona agathe bastian is incredibly wooden in fact she was never an actress at all but a german tourist spotted in bali by one of the producers give this amusing trash a look 7 out of 10,positive
mystics in bali is a wonderfully bizarre off the beaten path indonesian horror supernatural flick about an american writer researching black magic she is experienced the voodoo of the caribbean but she runs into some real trouble as a student of the leak in bali there are a lot of disjointed plot points and the dialogue is weak but the music i doubt traditional balinese music has been used in a horror flick before and total oddity of a flying head make this a worthwhile view for fans of the unusual,positive
the movie is called the giant claw and it was originally written by samuel newman in 1957 i and my boyhood friends were 11 and twelve year olds at that very young age we attended in a group the weekend monster theater at which time the above film was featured having never seen the movie we of course were taken completely by surprised by the flying monster each time it appeared i and the rest of our group exploded with frightful wails of terror screams of fright and piercing cries of horror this noise was echoed and multiplied in volume many times when they joined the cacophony of noises throughout the rest of the theater truth was the management was tickled pink by our childish fears and antics the movie itself proved nonsensical poorly made juvenal shylock half baked and phony in every respects still for 1957 it was the stuff of frighting childhood dreams and we were of that age as an adult i am amused at what i considered frightening and snicker at sci fi scenes from b picture actor like jeff morrow dabbs greer and what the character s called a nightmare chicken yet in retrospect they were the heroes of my youth and the foundation of what today are considered classic monsters of my childhood enjoy the novelty youth does not last long,negative
i really can not understand why this movie was made at least you get to see some standard b actors such as jeff morrow morris ankrum and mara corday who is a cute as she can be well you guessed it this thing is about a big bird what you could not have guessed is that it crossed the universe believe it or not to build a nest and lay eggs on our pale blue dot from carl sagan this film has got to win the award for the use of the most stock film shots ever in more than one sequence you see folks running in panic in the streets of new york shots taken straight from the beast from 20 000 fathoms the special effects were not special the bird was laughable and there are so many continuity mistakes i must have missed the transition from mara thinking jeff was a real immature jerk to the heavy romance never the less i watched the movie wishing it would end yet interested enough to want to know how it would end it seems to me that considering what a menace this bird was supposed to be that there would be whole raft of scientists and military types trying to figure out how to kill this thing there were not just a handful maybe because of the ridiculously low budget i am glad however to have a copy to add to my 50 s b monster collection there is no other film in my collection as bad as this one i loved it,positive
employed as part of a team that cleans corpses off the street a young necrophile enjoys taking home body parts and whole corpses where possible for him and his girlfriend to enjoy in this low budget flick from germany banned upon initial release in several countries nekromantik definitely comes with some shock value as it depicts in grisly detail just how the two lovers use their corpses and body parts in their lovemaking routines what is more the film even manages to drum up some sympathy for its protagonist who is ostracised by his colleagues and who does everything possible to satisfy his girlfriend s interests one gets the sense that she was always more into it than him unfortunately the film falls apart around halfway through as his girlfriend walks out leading to him quite literally meandering around he cries in the bathtub goes to watch a horror movie that is not nearly nasty enough for him and the list goes on as he wallows in depression and yet while the fact that the story comes to a virtual halt in the second half is perplexing it is arguably the less shocking nature of the majority of the second half that underwhelms the most the extent of the young couple s deviancy is the real highlight here particularly with all the intriguing questions of what led to them to have such a perverse interest in corpses the graphic scenes of the protagonist and his work colleagues cleaning corpses up is pretty intense too those interested in a shock or two will likely not be disappointed here but the film is also never quite the cohesive whole that it could have been,negative
i have a penchant for applying my own little award system to genre pictures salo takes the most disturbing award dead alive aka brain dead wins the goriest film award caligula runs away with the most over sexed honor well film lovers here we have my vote for nastiest film ever if you have seen it you know why the story concerns a young couple with a predilection for all things dead this works out well for them as the boyfriend works for a crime scene clean up crew as luck would have it one day he comes across a rather well preserved corpse rather well as in it is a rotted blue hunk of tissue while on duty he manages to sneak the body home much to the delight of his lady friend and they go about having their dirty little way with it it soon becomes clear that the girl is enjoying the company of the corpse more than her still breathing boyfriend and runs off with it needless to say this does nothing healthy for his already deranged mental state being dumped for another guy is bad being dumped for a dead one is even worse believe it or not watching them have sex with the gooey body is not the nastiest thing you will see here all manners of assorted atrocities are committed for your viewing un pleasure most all of them rank in the so sick you can hardly watch category i will not spoil the best of them just rest assured that gore hounds will most certainly be pleased if not disgusted for better or worse the film is not very competently made the corpse and gore effects are very good but the film stock and technique are both pretty sub standard and with the script being so barren and the acting merely passable the shock moments are all that will keep hardened viewers watching till the gruesome conclusion if you are looking for good story telling look else where if you are looking for a good sex flick look else where if you are looking for the ultimate stomach churner you have found it 6 10,positive
godzilla vs the smog monster is the kind of movie that does not know what kind of movie it wants to be it must be a kid s movie because the protagonist is an annoying kid who idolizes godzilla yet some scenes would be more at home in a horror film as when crowds of people are asphyxiated and skeletonized by the smog monster s noxious emissions at other times there are signs that this movie wants to be a drug fueled exploitation flick there are weird cartoon sequences that seem inspired by yellow submarine and at one point a character in a dance club starts hallucinating for no apparent reason that his fellow party goers have paper mache fish for heads there is also a perfunctory astronomy lesson with no real connection to the rest of the film plus a shot where hedorah the titular smog monster flies through a construction site and the structure collapses but with no sound was the recording track for scene damaged at some point if that were the case you would think the filmmakers could re record the sound effects or substitute a clip from the studio s library but i am forgetting what this movie is all about which is godzilla and the need to protect the environment in 1971 when the film was released this message had not yet become a cliche in children s movies it was also a very relevant at a time when there was little to no regulation of factory emissions and hazardous waste disposal and when rivers in downtown cleveland could suddenly burst into flames but godzilla makes a very odd environmental spokesman to say the very least when he first appeared in 1954 s gojira he was the embodiment of the death and destruction that nuclear weapons could and had unleashed on japan and on the world now however he is tokyo s savior a completely benign figure who does not knock over a single building even by accident godzilla does not always have to play the villain but he should at least be an anti hero dangerous to man even when he is protecting us from other monsters godzilla also makes one of his least dramatic entrances in this film instead of slowly rising from the sea or bursting out of an iceberg he ambles out of the sunrise as annoying trumpet music blares regrettably this score will be repeated in most scenes where the big guy appears as for godzilla s opponent toho has come up with one of its cooler ideas here hedorah is not a single organism but rather colony of billions of rapidly splitting microorganisms this means that it can change form at will and can repair almost any damage suffered by producing new cells unfortunately the idea just did not work what we end up with at least in the monster s final form is a giant misshapen blob of rubber under which the actor can barely move this brings us to the battles between the monsters usually the high point of any godzilla film some of the earlier fights are not too badly staged but once hedorah learns to fly godzilla s main tactic seems to be standing around and failing his arms angrily and as for the final battle near mount fuji having the military build a pair of giant electrodes to dehydrate the smog monster is a fairly good idea since by this point it is clear that godzilla can not do it on his own but why oh why did this have to mean a protracted sequence in which our hero rips apart his now helpless opponent piece by piece twice to make sure that every drop of moisture is evaporated would not it have been more effective for hedorah to instantly dry out and crumble to dust like a vampire exposed to sunlight this is not godzilla vs the smog monster it is godzilla vs the giant mud pie there is also the question of how godzilla knew the purpose and operation of the electrodes and why his atomic breath provided power to them rather than blasting them to bits like everything else it touches but this is not where our suspension of disbelief is really tested i mentioned earlier that godzilla had to go through the process of drying out hedorah twice this is because the first time there proves to some life still left in the blob of filth and its prior flying form escapes into the sky so how does godzilla catch up to his rival and bring him back simple he flies after him that is right godzilla actually flies by using his atomic breath as a form of jet propulsion this may be the single most ridiculous sequence in the history of japanese cinema i am not recommending that no one ever see this movie it achieves a sort of campy grandeur almost to the point of being so bad that it is good i would suggest viewing this film just once so you can gawk in amazement at its sheer awfulness or if that is too much for you just type in godzilla flies on youtube you will not be disappointed by the result,negative
this movie is so weird it is almost comical better known as godzilla vs the smog monster this flick tries to take on a different format that resembles a poor man s james bond movie seems to be put together kind of haphazardly but really pretty interesting godzilla battles hedrah or hedora a creature spawned from industrial pollution and rank waste material probably the strangest in the godzilla series,negative
how can i begin to describe this amazing film random images pop into my head from memory tony curtis as a dashing fortune teller and huckster prancing around his san francisco bachelor pad wearing a sorcerer s outfit one of his elderly female clients being possessed by an indian spirit and being tossed down a flight of stairs you do not even need the pause button to see that the stunt double going down the stairs is a big dude in a dress and wig burgess meredith muddling through one of his last film roles playing a senile old coot with amazing realism to no one s surprise an indian shaman with a yiddish sounding new york city accent and a penchant for stale one liners a naked midget dressed up like an evil reincarnated indian fetus covered with goo a topless susan strassberg hovering in the fourth dimension and firing lightning bolts at the evil spirit using electrical energy from a huge 70 s model computer you must see this film,positive
i found the manitou to be quite an interesting if not cheesy film it starts off quite well and the pace moves along nicely as the story draws you in the first half is dedicated to the story and what happens before the demon is born the second half deals with what occurs after he is born and climaxes with a cheesy sci fi ending the acting is very solid throughout and the characters believable the highlight of the film is supposedly when the demon is born as he breaks out of the fetus attached to the woman s back i did not find it particularly impressive though i did however enjoy the story about the indian spirit and how this would be his fourth or fifth incarnation i have always had a soft spot for mythology and demon births probably from watching too many xena warrior princess episodes the film is spoilt mainly by the ultra cheesy ending that looks like something out of an old star trek episode up until that point i thought the story worked well as a serious film but the ending brought it into cheese territory and ruined it for me it is not that i do not like cheese but you can not just introduce it in the last 10 minutes of a film and get away with it,positive
this is the funniest single entry into the godzilla series it is so incredibly bad that there is not a single scene that does not have at least a chuckle or two and many that have slap your knee hilarity to them all unintentional the director jun fukoda was no stranger to the godzilla series and had already demonstrated that he could deliver a solidly competent b movie but this are not one of those and it is hard to say where fukoda s head was at when he made this film we see actors miss their cues we see strings lifting flying monsters we have a robot with an idiotic smile painted on his face we have a theme song popping up at the end that is only a parody of a pop music movie theme we have an annoying little kid actor that can not act we have a cheesy giant cock roach rubber suit flopping about crushing buildings and then running from godzilla with the gate of an old woman we have the magic words that bring megalon to life rise up megalon hey get up while nymphettes do a veil dance we have a background music that sounds like easy listening played at twice the tempo obvious stock footage from previous godzilla films get inter cut in the fight scenes we have a special guest appearance from gigan called in no showing or explanation how from a galaxy called space hunter m now what wit could actually come up with that as the name of galaxy really you must see this film at least once in your life and if you do not see the humor in it that one time see it again because it will dawn on you like the blast of a heat ray that yeah this film really does make no sense whatsoever obviously made in two days by a group of brainy grammar school students who happen to be drunk one could not make a parody of the godzilla films as funny as this yet incredibly there is no sign that this was not intended to be taken seriously but we do not have to take it seriously just because it was intended that way and taken as a comedy it is just grand,negative
as a kid i used to enjoy this particular godzilla film as it featured two foes for godzilla and a robot to aid godzilla as i look back on it i am not as fond of it for one there is just a lot of footage from other godzilla films mainly godzilla versus gigan for another it is just kind of weird and not in the godzilla versus hedorah good way either at the same time i do not really count it as the low point of the showa era either as i give that award to the godzilla film titled godzilla s revenge in the united states granted i would assume it goes by another name in japan as godzilla does not get any revenge in the film there were other godzilla films i liked less than this one but this is the one i am reviewing today this one also is one of two godzilla films to get the mst3k treatment the other being godzilla versus the sea monster which i find to be a good entry into the godzilla series during its initial run the story has nuclear testing affecting things quite adversely as monster island where godzilla resides is exploding and stuff right at the beginning also affected is a place known as seatopia which is an underwater kingdom like atlantis they have had enough and unleash their monster megalon to bring the world to its knees for some reason they also need an inventor s robot as the monster megalon needs to follow something in order to stay focused the inventor along with a kid who is either his brother or son and a dude who is like an action type guy must get jet jaguar out of the clutches of the seatopians and use it to get godzilla to fight off the terrible megalon if that were not bad enough the space cockroaches who were clearly beaten in the last movie for reasons unknown agree to work with the seatopians and lend out their monster gigan this film made for a very funny episode of mst3k as there is just so much strange stuff going on seriously why the heck did they show people go up and down the steps of that one house so many times there is also the fact air conditioners are hung in said house and the whole strange living arrangement too perhaps how they were related was explained more in the japanese cut of this i enjoyed the final fight as the gang started making it out to be a heavyweight fight so not the best godzilla film not by a long shot someone said it was better than godzilla versus gigan but i preferred that one better as i liked the characters in that one better and the whole trying to uncover the identity of the strange duo running the godzilla tower here we get the strange trio but when i look at it know it reminds me of johnny quest as we have the inventor the boy and the more athletic racing type they just needed to add another kid and a dog jet jaguar was apparently designed by a kid as they had a contest for kids to enter to design the robot kind of surprised they went with one that is obviously just ultraman with more colors still though it still has a fond place in my heart because it did provide me with entertainment anytime i saw it as a child,positive
one of countless big bug features to come out of the you s during the 1950s jack arnold s tarantula is one of the most enjoyable of its kind after gordon douglas them really kicked off the fad in the previous year tarantula has everything audiences came to love about the genre a dusty middle of nowhere arizona setting the handsome yet charisma free hero the screeching love interest the shady doctor who certainly knows far more than he is letting on and of course the giant terrifying monster what makes this film slightly more interesting than others of its ilk is the fact that it does not blame radiation on the deformed beast but actually attempts to tell a story after renowned biological research scientist eric jacobs eddie parker is found dead in the desert apparently suffering from a rapid form of acromegaly dr matt hastings john agar is called in from a nearby town to investigate when hastings suggests an autopsy to figure out what brought on such a rare disease and how it killed jacobs so quickly dr gerald deemer leo g carroll one of jacobs colleagues refuses his request and signs the death certificate himself back at deemer s isolated desert research lab it is revealed that the doctor has been experimenting on animals in a bid to save the future planet s food shortage and has increased the size of a number of his subjects including a tarantula after a fire destroys deemer s lab the arizona landscape is soon overshadowed by the giant hungry arachnid while a radioactive isotope does crop up at one point the 50 foot spider is purely the handiwork of a scientist with good intentions rather than government nuclear tests and therefore tarantula creates an interesting and conflicted character in caroll s deemer caroll certainly chews every scene but proves a far more appealing male lead than the bland agar yet the real star of tarantula is the creature itself the combination of matte effects and the use of a real spider which would later be used on the incredible shrinking man 1957 have aged spectacularly well only failing to convince during the brief close up shots of the last thing a few poor and seemingly blind souls see before they are gobbled up while the climax is over before you know it there is fun to be had in trying to spot a young and uncredited clint eastwood as a fighter pilot it is no longer scary was it ever but it has charm by the bucket load,negative
i have always wondered if director jack arnold could have raised higher should he have been able to work with big budget products and top stars casts arnold was a very smart filmmaker with a most direct and plain style that gave us such b classic films in different genres as the creature from the black lagoon and the incredible shrinking man in the horror sci fi line no name on the bullet audie murphy s best western no doubt and even the fine comedy the mouse that roared peter sellers was not a top star then who knows tarantula is just another of arnold s little b horror gems of the 50 s a most simple movie about insects turning huge to terrorize people in this case the spider in the title the film is interesting and enjoyable for fans of the genre guilty and i remember it really scared me a lot when i saw it as a kid though they would have never run for an oscar john agar mara corday and leo g carroll where very good in the main roles in a kind of film that was not about acting but about special effects and horrifying situations just think for a second what it would be like to be chased by a hungry building size tarantula spider all in all tarantula stands as a good piece in the b horror genre released by an intelligent director,positive
following up one of the greatest horror films of all time the sequel could not be further from the quality of the first film coming in at nearly 2 hours you will feel every excruciating second of this lackluster film as you try to figure out why any of this ties into the original the script could not be bothered to put in much effort the effects team fell asleep at the wheel and the writers found themselves producing an african documentary instead of a horror film until the last 15 minutes there is nothing horrific scary or even unsettling as a lover of films and specifically a lover of bad films this was nearly unwatchable and had me checking the time every few minutes in a fight to turn it off early i can not understand how they got this so wrong and i fear i may need it exorcised from my mind,positive
inside this terrible film is an excellent film screaming to get out there are moments of real power and and frightening beauty but they are drowning in sludge one wonders if this mixture is a result of conflict amongst those making the film or of boorman simply not being able to keep his grasp of a vision,negative
10 10 better than citizen kane casablanca and vertigo,positive
