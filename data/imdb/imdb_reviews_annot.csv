0,12-tt0094074,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094074/,Even Superman couldn't save this one!,"There is a new nuclear arms race underway. Superman is forbidden to interfere with Earth's internal affairs. However a little boy's letter and taunting from the paper's owner David Warfield, Superman decides to make a declaration at the UN to destroy all of the world's nuclear weapons. Lacy Warfield (Mariel Hemingway) is the new woman at the paper who falls for Clark Kent. Meanwhile, nephew Lenny (Jon Cryer) helps spring Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) from prison work detail. Using a strand of Superman's hair, Lex Luthor creates Nuclear Man.  The movie is pretty boring and even more silly than all the others. There are a lot of problems with the ridiculous nature of this movie. Nephew Lenny is annoyingly silly. The premise of the world politics is stupid. The idea that Superman would reveal his identity and kiss it away just to ease his mind seems wrong. The effects may have actually gotten worst. However the biggest mistake is the idea that Superman would get rid of all the nuclear weapons.  During WWII, Superman never really battle the Nazis or the Japanese directly. It was a matter of Superman not be a God like figure to direct and interfere with mankind's wars. If Superman is to act like God, then the reaction from the earth's political and commercial powers have to act more realistically. This movie is too silly and simplistic dealing with world politics. The whole thing is a wrong idea.",negative
1,5-tt0094074,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094074/,The Paradoxical Son...,"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace is a good movie, but it was a failure in my opinion. It was great seeing the Superman cast back together again, including Gene Hackman who we haven't seen since Superman II. This time, Alexander and Ilya Salkind were not producing the movie. Instead, Menaham Golan and Yoram Globus, the owners of Cannon films, were producing. If you ask me, the Salkinds knew how to make a Superman movie better than those two.   In Superman IV, Superman hears the threat of Nuclear War over and over, and so he decides that he will rid the world of every nuclear weapon known to man. At the same time, Lex Luthor has broken out of jail again and this time, his sidekick is his dorky nephew Lenny. The two criminals create a device that they put on one of the nuclear weapons and that ends up creating Nuclear Man. Nuclear Man has the same powers as Superman but, the only difference is that Nuclear Man gets his power from the sun.  
While all of this is going on, The Dailey Planet is being controlled by a tycoon and his daughter who has her eye on Clark Kent.  
So Superman has a big job here: SAVE THE WORLD FROM NUCLEAR DESTRUCTION!  I'm going to say that, anyone who has seen the first three Superman films, then just go ahead and see IV because it would be a shame to not see the film that is last in the series. But, in my opinion, I didn't like it much. I think Alexander & Ilya Salkind would've made a hell of a last movie.",negative
2,4-tt0059466,Monsters Crash the Pajama Party,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059466/,"Horrible movie, but great DVD!","Very odd and very short color film that tries as a horror comedy.  There are no opening credits.  The film opens with a man wearing a lab coat with ""Mad Doctor"" on his coat pocket.  He talks to the audience for a while and then we get an announcer read to us who is in the movie, who made it, who edited it, etc while we see a man in a gorilla suit in different settings.  Looks like an amateur film.  Plot concerns a group of sorority pledges who have to spend the night in a haunted house.  The house has a mad doctor, a gorilla, a hunchback, an oriental woman, and a werewolf in the basement.  Whole thing is done in fun with gorilla frequently holding up signs with one word phrases.",positive
3,2-tt0059466,Monsters Crash the Pajama Party,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059466/,This film manages to be both fun and amazingly stupid!,"The acting, costumes and dialog for ""Monsters Crash the Pajama Party"" are all quite terrible. In fact, it's one of the cheesiest films of an era known for its cheesy teen movies. But, it still manages to entertain--mostly because it never takes itself seriously and often makes fun of itself. Because of this, the bad film has a genial quality about it that make it goofy fun. Among the best examples is the guy in the gorilla suit. He not only introduces the film but makes commentary using giant signs with words printed on it. Also, as the film is introduced, a bizarre narrator says LOTS of strange and occasionally funny remarks. Another is the mad scientist--who wears a lab coat that says 'Mad Doctor' right on it! Because this film is intentionally bad, I really don't think it's appropriate to give it a numerical score. For those who love the silly monster films of the 1960s, it's well worth seeing. For anyone just wanting to see a good film, then it's definitely one you should skip! Harmless fun.",positive
4,10-tt0112462,Batman Forever,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112462/,Better than most people remember.,"While the Batman franchise has been much maligned in recent years due to the disappointing performance of the last live-action film, Forever was second in quality only to the first Bat-film. It added color back into a Gotham that had gotten way too claustrophobic, and brought the tone back to something resembling the comics. Jim Carrey is a scene-stealer and dead on as The Riddler, and Val Kilmer is the perfect Bruce Wayne and Batman. Tommy Lee Jones does a great turn as Two-Face, unfortunately he isn't given enough to do and therefore comes across too cartoony, minus the angst of the character in the comics. One other big complaint is the new score - gone are Danny Elfman's orchestrations.  Elliot Goldenthal's music would have been fine if not for his predecessor. Most people tend to lump this one in the 'lousy' section, it seems, but it was one of the biggest movies of '95 and a very faithful adaption overall. Now if they'd only release the director's cut",positive
5,1-tt0112462,Batman Forever,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112462/,Jim Carrey stole the show,"Some people talk about ""the stick of straw that broke the camel's back"", meaning when something reached the tipping point. So when did the Batman franchise go bad? Well, ""Batman Forever"" was getting silly, but it still had Jim Carrey to steal the show as The Riddler (""Batman and Robin"" had about as many good qualities as a barrel of toxic waste). Personally, I don't know why they had to have Batman (Val Kilmer) going through therapy; remove that and he still would have been a cool superhero with neat gadgets. Tommy Lee Jones wasn't bad as Two-Face. Nicole Kidman and Chris O'Donnell, as Dr. Chase Meridian and Robin, respectively, didn't really add anything.  Overall, the point is that when Joel Schumacher took over directing, the franchise went downhill. Part of the problem was that while Tim Burton created an eerie Gotham City that looked like New York in the 1940s, Joel Schumacher created a Gotham City that looked like it was trying too hard to be ""Blade Runner"".  So, the franchise starting getting stale with this one, but Jim Carrey kept the movie from being unwatchable. As Edward Nygma, one of Bruce Wayne's employees, he had some great lines. In the movie, Nygma proposes a device that rests atop TV sets and reads peoples' minds, but Wayne rejects it, considering it too dangerous. Thus, Nygma becomes The Riddler, and he's the best character in the movie.",negative
6,6-tt0118688,Batman & Robin,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118688/,Holy Cr**py Movie Batman!!!!!,"This is hands down the worst film ever made in the history of the existence of the universe. There have been some bad films made but this is a travesty. It is hard to believe that money was spent to make this. It could have been used on something else (charity I suppose). I was 12 when I went to see this and it broke my heart. Batman was my favorite comic book and character when I was a kid and this film broke my spirit. The excellence of the Tim Burton/Michael Keaton films are long gone. The dark emotional center and development of the hero and the villains is sidelined for action sequences, action sequences and some more action sequences, some of them incorporating the worst CGI and model work ever seen on film.   The casting itself had to the potential to make a good film. George Clooney could have made a great Batman (square jawed, popular with the ladies), the only thing going against him being that can be too laid back (maybe with a better script he could do the darker material). Uma Thurman is perfect for Poison Ivy. She is a good looking yet quirky actress, but you wouldn't know it by the emphasis on camp context and innuendo in this film. Arnie is maybe a little miscast as Mr Freeze, but he does well getting a chance to use some 'great' puns, but someone who can come across as more evil would  have been better. Then there is Chris O'Donnell and Alicia Silverstone as Robin and Batgirl. Let's just say more charisma can come from a line of fridge freezers with nothing in them. The only decent performance comes from Michael Gough as Alfred, only one of two actors to have appeared in all four films. His performance is wonderful in this otherwise mess of a film.  The blame for this disaster can be laid at the hands of Joel Schumacher. His direction misplaced and his intentions misguided. He may have redeemed himself with Phone Booth, but he will always be the man who destroyed Batman in my eyes.",positive
7,1-tt0118688,Batman & Robin,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118688/,"What almost killed the Batman franchise? ""The Ice Age!""","Strangely enough, that's one ice-related pun that Mr.Freeze doesn't use in this film. Though it does adequately describe the movie. What was I thinking, watching Batman & Robin for a third time? Even worse, what was I doing actually starting to enjoy it?  Yes, there's something endearingly awful about a film that fails on almost every technical level. But it wasn't always so. The first two films in the franchise, anchored by the strong, and much undervalued lead of Michael Keaton, were enjoyable pop-art excursions by Tim Burton. The first, still by far the best, allowed Jack Nicholson to ham it up amongst retro stylings and the music of Prince. The second, Batman Returns, was a less successful effort to homage German expressionist cinema, the darkest of the four films, and struggled slightly under the weight of three villains.  The lesson wasn't learnt, and the usage of multiple baddies has been a fixed staple ever since. With the third, Batman Forever, the flat acting of new bat Val Kilmer was coupled with Joel Schumacher's garish direction and Chris O'Donnell's irritating Robin. Akiva Goldsman was now the writer, and any sense of depth had given way to trite puns and disjointed set pieces.  And so it was that everything that was symptomatically flawed with the series was expanded upon and magnified for the fourth, and by far the weakest, instalment. George Clooney has accepted a lot of the blame for this film, a humble admission but unfair. While he's clearly miscast as both Batman and Bruce Wayne, he doesn't give a bad performance per se. Rather, it's his back up that lets the side down. Uma Thurman (am I the only one who doesn't think she's that good-looking?) has a great time overdoing it as Poison Ivy, but she's joined by Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze. Schwarz, not exactly known for his acting skill, is unrecognisable under his costume, so what's the point? He gets to call Batman ""Batunbuuurg"", refers to Robin as ""Buuurd Bouy"" and only has 100 lines in total. The fact that 26% of these lines are lame puns on the word ""ice"" that even a two-year-old would struggle to find funny is even more deplorable. And when you hear Freeze tell Batman ""Yew arr not zending mee too da cooola"" the urge to use the video's ""stop"" button is almost insurmountable.  Bane makes up the trio, a monosyllabic muscleman in a gimp mask. A completely unnecessary addition, he offers nothing to the plot and goes largely forgotten. The introduction of wonky-mouthed Alicia Silverstone as a fatuous Batgirl character is also grating. And why doesn't her costume come fitted with Batnipples like the rest?  Tiny traces of amusement can be gleaned from Ivy's dialogue, with her urges that her ""garden needs tending"" adding some form of adult tone to the humour. However, it's unrelenting innuendo - ""I'll help you grab your rocks"" - does start to wear thin very quickly. I did smile at Batman's cashcard: ""I never leave the cave without it""; and it's also nice to see some small references from other films. Even if it is just a glimpse of the Riddler's costume from Forever, some guards paraphrasing Cobra or some street bystanders dressed as Clockwork Orange Droogs. In fact, the idea of a Batman film as completely OTT comedy send-up may have worked, were the rest of the humour more sophisticated. ""It's the hockey team from Hell""; ""So this is where you hang out""; ""I'll cancel the pizza""; oh, how lame and functional the dialogue is!  The film wraps up with a rather pathetic plot contrivance, and George having to dish out bland platitudes. ""Not all heroes wear masks""; ""to give life... that's true power"". Oh, it really is abominably bad. Batman & Robin exists as a classic example of the Hollywood system folding in under its own weight. However, the universal slating this one got neglects one factor: while the least successful, it still made over $230,000,000 at the box office. I wonder how many people would be satisfied with ""failures"" like that?",positive
8,8-tt0074148,Ape,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074148/,I wanted to like it.,"Well, I just had the good fortune to see this movie on the big screen in glorious 3D(although my 3d glasses kept falling off of my regular glasses) and must say that all of the previous posts(with exception of the person who gave it like 9 stars) just did not get this movie and never will. Yes it is bad, terribly bad. Yes the acting sucks etc. Did this detract from my enjoyment of the film? Not a whit. I can imagine that in 2d on a TV the charm could be significantly diminished but in its original 3d glory this is not to ""B"" missed . I cant fathom all of the bad posts from folks who claim to like this genre of movies. I mean look at the godzilla movies that were coming out at this time frame, pure cheese! Yet I love them just the same! If your idea of a giant monster movie is the Hollywood godzilla or the peter jackson king kong then by all means please skip this. If on the other hand you wish peter jackson would take his next million dollars and sink it into a remake of meet the feebles then you might get a few chuckles out of this movie.",negative
9,9-tt0074148,Ape,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074148/,King Kong's Korean kousin flips off Army,"The first time I watched this, I was so tired at the time, nothing made sense. This movie was no exception. I didn't even get the chance to finish it, I guess I just fell asleep. Well, I watched it again last night and it STILL doesn't make sense! None at all! It's just far too badly done. There are too many mistakes to list, so i won't even attempt to, all I want to know is if the film makers were serious when they made this movie. Because if they were, I pity them. I could make a better movie and look at me. I'm only 16! Ayy yay yay yay!   One out of many things that really bothered me in this movie was the monster. Now, I got over the whole fact that it is blatantly a man in a monkey suit, but some of the things that stuck around and I couldn't get out of my head were the fact that:  1.) The Ape flipped off the camera! What? Last time I checked, Apes don't intentionally flip off cameras or anybody else for that matter.  2.) At one point when the Ape was stomping a village by a mountain, the Ape was wearing high top tennis shoes. Tennis shoes!!!! No, I'm sorry Mr. Film director, Apes don't wear tennis shoes. Please, if you are going to make a movie, and it involves the portrayal of a wild animal with a human in an animal suit, remember, wild animals don't wear clothing. That's just a little fact of life of which everyone needs to be aware.  This was a terrible movie. But not too terrible in a bad way. It was more terrible in a good, funny way. It was fun to watch, it was easy to make fun of, it was an experience to remember. Movies cannot be made this bad on purpose, they are accidents. Terrible terrible accidents. Accidents like 3-Mile Island or the Jimmy Carter election. They are accidents that should have been prevented through careful evaluation of all people claiming to be film makers. Please, if you ever hear of a movie like this ever being made again, take a bat and start beating in the head of the director. Then take a lighter and some gasoline, and burn down the studio. Then go get a paper shredder and shred the film. Then take the remaining shreds and toss them into the fire at the movie studio. Nothing this bad should ever exist again. Good Day.",positive
10,7-tt1316037,Birdemic: Shock and Terror,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1316037/,The worst movie of the decade and probably the most preachy,"Given that ""Birdemic"" has been blasted by many critics, I think I should say something positive about it to start off with. The scenery of Half Moon Bay is agreeable, for one thing, and Ms. Moore has at least a modicum of charisma; also, anyone who appreciates a stylish blue hybrid Mustang rolling along in a stately manner gets to savor that very sight in many lingering shots. All positive aspects of this film.  Less positive aspects of this film are legion, so much so that I'm reminded of my wish that IMDb.com would allow a vote on a scale from 1 to 100 rather than 1 to 10 (in which case ""Birdemic"" would rate at least a 3 out of 100 for the reasons mentioned, and perhaps a 4 for meaning well (though the message about global warming comes across in a preachy and ham-handed manner)). Still, something about the profoundly amateurish quality of this film makes it feel a little unfair to rate it at all ~ in much the same way that it would feel wrong to grade a term paper on the basis of some rough notes jotted down before writing the paper rather than the paper itself. This film very much reminds me of a rough draft ~ a sort of rough visualization of what the film would have been if the producer had more resources at his disposal (thus making the upcoming larger-budget sequel all the more intriguing).  Yet, I wonder if this film might have been less entertaining if it were better made. If it featured better sound, editing, writing, acting, direction and special effects, it might just be a forgettable homage to ""The Birds""; its very flaws elevate (or should I say depress?) it to a special level otherwise occupied by a few special films like ""The Room"" and ""Manos: the Hands of Fate"" ~ the legendary realm of films that are so bad they're good. So, giving it the benefit of the doubt as a real film and not just a rough draft, I tender my vote of 1 out of 10 and hope that other fans of this film will also give it an appropriately low vote and insure its rightful place on the Bottom 100 (once it gathers the requisite number of votes).",positive
11,10-tt1316037,Birdemic: Shock and Terror,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1316037/,"really awful, but strangely entertaining","First of all, to approach ""Birdemic: Shock and Terror"" with any kind of hope of witnessing a good feature film is utter lunacy. ""Amateur"" is a word a thousand times too generous for this film's description. Even given its low budget of $10,000, the majority of which seems to have gone on car fuel, the film is a joke. The acting is unspeakably bad, the ""special"" effects aren't worth mentioning, the music is corny and inappropriate, and the film's editing techniques have all the marvel of a flip-book.  The only way to enjoy this film is to treat it as exactly that, a joke. The above faults of the film are so glaring that the film becomes one huge joke that you can laugh along to. However, even this joke wears thin pretty quickly, and you're left feeling quite empty, as if you've been cheated out of 95 minutes of your life.  Nonetheless, I am firmly convinced that it is the director James Nguyen who is having the last laugh, as he has created a film so notoriously bad that everyone wants to see it. Perhaps the joke is on us, and the director's intention was to see just how popular this film could be through its infamy. Even so, absolutely nothing can forgive how bad this film really is. It makes Battlefield Earth feel like Star Wars, and makes the special effects of 1933's King Kong look like those of Avatar. It is, quite simply, the worst film ever committed to celluloid.  Watching the trailer, I actually had a decent laugh, and thought it might be worth it. But having watched the finished product, the knowledge that somebody spent $10,000 making this ugly piece of garbage and then having the audacity to call it a film is infuriating, and actually quite offensive. People were PAID to produce this. With MONEY. I still don't believe it.",negative

The film literally makes no sense whatsoever and that is the brilliance of it. The story of the transvestite Glen/Glenda is told by not 1, but count them 2, yes 2 narrators. One of whom was the sad, pathetic drug addled Bela Lugosi. Watching him rambling almost incoherently ""Bevare, bevare..."" it is hard to imagine just 20 years before he was the toast of Broadway as ""Dracula"", just watching him spouting his mindless chatter gives the film a surreal quality. Obviously this was the biography of Wood himself and watching him take the angora sweater from his confused yet loving fiancée is priceless. This movie takes camp to a whole level of it's own.

14,0-tt1910621,Space Thunder Kids,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1910621/,"Dreadful animated movie, but also one to revel in its awfulness","I love animation/anime, and have done since a very early age. Space Thunder Kids is not the worst animated movie I've seen, but it is laughably bad and you, like I sort of did, might find some entertainment value in its awfulness.  The animation has a dull and unfinished quality to it. The backgrounds are often static, with the galactic backgrounds not doing anything for me, and the colours are flat. The character designs fare worse, they are stiff and forced, and the dubbing is rarely in sync with the lip movements. Actually, I think the lip movements were nearly always ahead of the speaking. Also in the beginning alone, there are objects that float around aimlessly and when they are hit with laser beams they pop in very slow motion, more reminiscent of balloons that take a long time to pop.  The music when it appears wasn't so bad in its orchestration at the time, it's just that afterwards it was very forgettable and there are times in the movie where you felt it could have had less music or that a scene didn't need any music. The characters I was mostly indifferent to, the Dark Emperor was intriguing by name but you don't know much about him while the lead characters are annoying. The voice acting/dubbing is very poor and sloppy, with the actors sounding as though they are not putting any effort in.  The story is another major problem. It is a very unoriginal and thin one. I liked the idea somewhat, don't get me wrong, but that idea was completely abandoned halfway through. Not only that, the film feels as though it has three different beginnings, three beginnings that feel disjointed and don't do much to move the story forward or set the tone of the story. The film is only a little over 80 minutes, but because the pace is so sluggish in places it feels longer. And I mustn't forget the writing, it is dreadfully cheesy. However, I found it impossible not to be amused, not because the dialogue was hilarious or anything but because the lines and delivery of them were so bad.  In conclusion, dreadful but had some novelty value. 1/10 Bethany Cox",positive

16,13-tt0103923,Captain America,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103923/,No. it's so bad it's good. enjoy it to laugh at it.,"I'm confirming it is lame. It suffers from the same issues as the 1994 Fantastic Four, but unlike FF I can give it a, it's so bad it's good stamp (And I'm very happy about that).  Captain America is a pretty easy comic to adapt to the big screen, it's just an action adventure war movie about a guy who sometimes wears a mask. They did take some liberties with the character that make my Fanboy radar point up, but it's superficial.  Steve Rodgers is now a boy from Southern California who has polio and offered himself up to the super soldier experiment headed up by a woman who escaped from the Nazis (The idea of a woman creating the star spangled avenger was cool, not enough female brainiacs in the comic book industry ).  Shortly after Steve Rodgers becomes Captain America the doctor is killed making Steve and The Red Skull the only one's like them. After stopping the Red Skull from destroying the White House he is trapped in Ice for 60 years and wakes up having to stop the Red Skull, who has formed an underground crime unit that basically is Hydra without saying it,again.   Proving how well Cap works as an action movie, Matt Salinger who plays Steve Rogers, wearing some sort of padding to make it look like he's got more than he does, barely wears the cartoonish suit they made for him (of course wearing the uniform makes him Captain America, duh)  It's got that 80s swagger to it. The Red Skull has his daughter do all the heavy lifting for most of the movie with her small army of rich Nazi brats who drive the fastest cars and wear the hottest fashions but more than capable with the guns.  They took some liberties with The Red Skull's origin too, I think this was to save money and film the entire movie in Italy (I'm also guessing that certain places in Italy look more like Southern California than New York City)  I am being harsh on the movie because I've grown to like the character more now than I ever did when I was a kid and saw this, but like I expressed before, the movie does have a so bad it's food quality that makes it real enjoyable.   http://cinemagardens.com",positive

As such, many film buffs who know little or nothing about Captain America have no doubt been picking this one up at the video store. Too bad nothing but pure crapulescence awaits them.  Where to begin? The movie has a dim look to it; the acting is second-rate; and the action and battle scenes are few and far between. It will disappoint most die-hard comic book fans, perhaps as much as those silly 1970s Cap films were. On a positive note, the action scenes aren't awful when the viewer finally gets to them.

18,0-tt0109770,The Fantastic Four,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109770/,Oh come on guys this is a great little film.,"The only way to describe this Roger Corman produced flick, is to compare it to an episode of Power Rangers or VR Troopers, on a $1million budget. It is fast paced and fun, over the top and cheesy, and its short comings are there for everyone to see.  In all honesty the cast make the most of what they are given. Alex Hyde White has just the right dryness for the part of Reed Richards, and Rebbeca Staab is quite fitting as Sue Storm. The other characters are less well represented with Dr Doom being the worst offender, over acting as he does through the heavily cheap body armour. The realisation of The Thing and The Human Torch is quite good. The Things full body costume is similar to those used in the Turtles movies, and the Torch is brought to life via some slick animation. Oley Sassone actually gets the best out of the action scenes and coaxes a good atmosphere.  This is a movie worth seeing. It manages to capture a little of the heart of Marvel comics in ways that Captain America(1991) and The Punisher(1989) weren't able to. It is a petty that more money couldn't have been made available because as a representation of the F4 it isn't bad at all.

The fact it isn't well known and considered mainstream is because it's so bad it's been brushed under the carpet.  With embarassing special effects, a cast who simply can't be bothered and some ridiculous over the top performances & soundtrack the whole thing is truly abyssmal.  I don't know what it is with the Fantastic Four but cinematically they just can't get a break. Maybe when they finally get added to the Marvel Universe they'll have their day but for now I think the 2005 movie is the best one going.

It is a bad movie- though I can see why people would find it entertaining to watch- but it is much better than the likes of Monster A-Go Go, Manos the Hands of Fate, The Wild World of Batwoman, Merlin's Shop of Mystical Wonders and Hobgoblins, and in general there are far worse as well. The best asset of Laserblast is the music score, which pulsates through the movie with great energy and atmosphere that is not matched with the rest of the movie. Cheryl Smith is sweet and sympathetic and Keenan Wynn is appropriately gruff. And I personally though the stop-motion and the aliens were quite good, of any of the movies on the ""10 Movies they Riffed"" list it is Laserblast that has the best special effects. Everything else comes up painfully short though, Roddy MacDowell is wasted to the point that you question why was he even in it, and Eddie Deezen has to be the most annoying bully ever seen in film. The story is a real drag as well, it makes very little sense if at all, has so much overlong filler that adds nothing to the storytelling and is one of those instances where the plot summary pretty much sums up the whole movie. It also doesn't know what to do with itself and takes forever to get going, it is half-an-hour until anything of the sort happens and then when the gun is found the rest of the movie is just stuff getting shot at. At best, the camera work and editing are haphazard, the dialogue is hysterically bad and the characters are not developed anywhere near enough or characterised very effectively to be believable or likewise. In conclusion, Laserblast is a bad movie that is rather dull and senseless and wastes McDowell but a great score, better-than-average stop-motion and effects and two decent performances make it not as bad as all that. 3/10 Bethany Cox",negative

It's hard to point to a single movie that is like this though. What some may say is ""so good it's bad"" may come off to others as just plain bad. However, everyone I have talked to who has seen this movie has agreed: Troll 2 is so horribly, shamelessly bad, that it is good.  The writing for film is more than awkward (take the redundant ""Stonehenge Magic Stone""), and the character dialogue sounds so incredibly unnatural they might as well be robots. The reason for this is because the man who wrote the script and directed it, Claudio Fragasso, is a native speaker of Italian. He wrote the script in English when English was (barely) his second language. The acting is absolutely terrible, but who can blame them? This was most likely the first (and last) film any of these actors have been in.  The costumes and special effects have that wonderful B-movie quality to them. While there are many blaringly obvious errors, I find that the smaller ones are actually funnier. Actors shaking when time is supposed to be ""frozen,"" or flies on their face during the climatic scenes. There are so many continuity mistakes that I sometimes found myself wondering if the director was putting them in on purpose. It was like every time the camera shot changed, the crew completely forgot how the previous shot was set up, and had the actors give their best guess on where they're supposed to be.  I think everyone needs to see at least a few horrible movies in their lifetime. Troll 2 is entertaining and hilarious, especially when watched with friends. The plot is ludicrous, but at least you never know what's going to happen next. Many scenes seem completely unnecessary, and this film simply does not bother to justify any of the things that happen in it. The end result is a horror B-movie that ends up being so horrible that you can't help but laugh. The only question I find myself asking now is do I give it a ""1"" because it was so bad, or a ""10"" because it was so good?",positive

For those of us who grew up in the 80's, that phrase is all too familiar. Especially for those who would rush home after school to watch our favorite strongman face off against the forces of evil that threaten the safety and security of his homeworld.  For my money, it was never better than when He-Man faced off against Skeletor for the struggle for Eternia.  I also remember the fantasies that I and my friends would have of traveling away to that world of magic and fantasy, to fight alongside He-Man as he defends Grayskull.  It truly was a series that was out of this world.  And now it's on Earth.  When I first heard about a live action movie, (mind you, I was twelve at the time), I was overly excited about it.  But I didn't get to see it until my late teens.  And I must say that it was very well done, especially in its presentation.  In fact it brought back those far away childhood memories of those late afternoons in front of the tv, or outside with the toys a make-shift Eternia setting with my friends.  I'll grant a few things that were wrong with the movie though.  There were times that I think the script was either badly edited, or just too rushed at certain points.  I'm also not thrilled about them being on earth, but understanding budget constraints and the idea to make these characters more real than fantasy help feed into that decision, so I let that one go.  I would have also liked to see more of the characters from the toys in the movie, but have no complaints that they made up a few cool characters, like Blade.  The casting choices, I felt, were really good.  Dolph Lundgren worked as He-Man, even though he can't act.  He looked the part, and even pulled off the role.  I could tell that he wasn't walking through the part, as many actor will do with character roles (right Mr. Clooney?).  And Frank Langella the PERFECT choice for Skeletor.  Langella managed to bring that character to life in a way that gave me chills.  Skeletor is perhaps one of the greatest villains ever imagined, but the cartoon made him a cackling villain, who was more a buffoon than anything, therefore he didn't seem threatening.  But seeing Langella make Skeletor more dark and evil put my faith back into the conviction as a great villain.  You don't have to be a die hard fan of the series to enjoy the movie.  It's great fun, imaginative, and it captures a moment in time.  Don't scrutinize the movie because it's different from the cartoon.  Look at it for what it is, and don't focus on its faults.  It had the power to recapture my imagination, so its not all that bad.",positive

I thought the first film was very good and does the game upon which it is based some justice.  Not the case with MKA.  The first problem is that they tried to fuse too much of MK2 with MK3.  Then, if you're going to replace a character with another actor (Christopher Lambert), then at least make sure the new actor does a batter job than the first. The first Raiden was a hard-ass, and you knew not to mess with him. The second Raiden was a wuss and every time we saw him he was going through a wall.  Weak portrayals of major MK characters was another flaw.  The actress who portrayed Sonya Blade was nowhere near as good as Bridgette Wilson (the first Sonya).  Same could be said with Cage (Linden Ashby).  What was the point of even having Ermac and Rain in the movie if they weren't going to be referred to? A very weak portrayal of Sindel, Kitana's mother and the actress who played her isn't fit to act in soap operas.  Line example: Kitana: ""My mother is dead."" Sindel: ""As will be her daughter!""

Perhaps the worst thing is the fight at the end with the two really bad CG ""animalities"", a cheesy idea from the game that should have stayed in the game.

The actions of the 'aliens' attempting to act human, the laughably awful voice-over for the 'lost' skeleton, and of course Animala's antics. Yet at the same time the movie never goes over board with its jokes.

It also just plain didn't work. Its like they TRIED to make a stupid movie. They succeeded. It was so stupid I couldn't watch it.  The other types of movies I mentioned worked because they were made as serious movies, at least for kids, and adults get a kick out of watching because of all the mistakes in them. This piece of schlock is one scene of DELIBERATE moronic humor after another.  For example, the constant references to science and scientists are a way to get us to laugh at an intentional mistake.

This film is high on silly-to-obnoxious characters, and corniness. The first few scenes in the film are particularly loaded down by corniness as we are introduced to the characters. There's eccentric Professor Challenger (Claude Rains) with his silly facial expressions, and boisterous but stuffy personality. There's Lord John Roxton (Michael Rennie) with his selfish and uncharming personality. There's Jennifer Holmes (Jill St. John) who starts out by trying to show the men a woman can also be worthy to take along on an expedition, but then becomes a useless, timid character who shows no strengths at all. The sexist remarks made by some male characters in the beginning become even more obnoxious, because Jennifer never comes through on showing strength, courage or ideas to help her crew members. The only strength she really proves is that she can pick out some elegant but inappropriate clothing to wear during the dangerous expedition. Jennifer has also brought along her silly, little poodle named Frosty. And then there's Costa (Jay Novello), a wimpy, greedy, seedy, little man. Throw in Fernando Lamas as Manual Gomez, the hired helicopter pilot who is also along for a side plot of personal revenge. He plots his murder-revenge and strums his guitar along the way (the natives even let him keep his guitar when the group is captured!) Not too many characters to really care for, but there are a few to possibly like such as Jennifer's brother, David (Ray Stricklyn.) David actually turns out to be more of a help then originally believed. A captured native girl (Vitina Marcus) turns out to be one of the better characters in the picture, but that is most likely because she has none of the corny lines and characteristics the expedition party's characters have. There's also corny drama from a love triangle that forms along the way. We all know Claude Rains (Phantom Of The Opera), Michael Rennie (The Day The Earth Stood Still) and others can do fine acting jobs, and the acting in this movie is fine--It's just most of the characters are so corny at times it should be embarrassing to the stars of the picture. The action in the film does not really build to any exciting levels as the crew is menaced by various creatures. The dinosaurs are lizards and reptiles with fins and horns applied to their bodies, and the giant spider is a rather lame effect (especially since it just hangs there, and only moves its legs a bit.) There is an unpleasant scene in which a real lizard fights a real reptile (portraying dinosaurs) that seems very politically incorrect by today's standards (and should have been a no-no even back in 1960.) Irwin Allen and 20th Century Fox could've done much better than this, and it is not nearly as good of a film as Journey To The Center Of The Earth (also from 20th Century Fox.) Still, The Lost World may entertain on a Saturday afternoon matinee level, and it is one of those movies collectors of horror and science fiction films will probably want to add to their 1950's and 1960's collections.",positive

I do agree it does have its problems. The film is low budget, and some of it does show, as some of the production values while not terrible are not great. Some of the editing could have been better, while the film is dully lit and some of the sets, locations and costumes are just okay if somewhat uninteresting. The dinosaur and dragon are quite good though. The film is too short, and I think too rushed as well, and while it was nice to listen to the soundtrack was forgettable soon after. Ben Syder does do what he can with the iconic detective known as Sherlock Holmes but I couldn't help thinking in terms of mannerisms and appearance he was miscast.  However, the direction was decent, as was the script which had some nice touches without being entirely exceptional. While it does have its holes and quite strange in its feel, the story is an interesting one and entertaining enough if you don't think about it too much, the villain is enjoyable and there are some good performances from Gareth David as a more quiet and composed Watson and Dominic Keating. Elizabeth Arends is lovely, and the climax was diverting and much better than I expected.  Overall, there is nothing outstanding on display, and those who are looking for a faithful adaptation will be disappointed.

45,17-tt0089185,The Galaxy Invader,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089185/,The title is misleading,"Appearing like a stranger from a strange land, The Galaxy Invader must have thrown people for a loop back in '85. At a time when slashers were all the rage, the PG level thrills and cracked sci-fi spills are about the last thing you could expect, but lowbrow legend Don Dohler pulls it off and then some. The key to it all is commitment, there's a fair amount of overlap between cast and crew and many of both cast and crew cut their teeth on previous Dohler pictures, which he had been making for a while. It all adds up to confidence, to actors pinging off each other with dramatic result, bold use of shaky effects, competent framing, poignant message, this is a film where all the lunacy can't overpower the fact that these people weren't screwing around. There's effort here and it shines. The plot wraps around an alien crash-landing in redneck backwoods territory espied by a couple of mean spirited idiots, Joe Montague and Frank Custor (can you smell the sweat?) who elect to catch and sell it. Meanwhile, a sky watching professor and his student are on the hunt for the being, and Joe's wife and daughter are just trying to get away safe from him. The film wrong-foots the viewer pretty early on, man is the aggressor here, man the wild beast. The title is a misnomer, the alien isn't any kind of an invader and is actually kinda sympathetic, also it has the look of a novelty store riff on the Creature from the Black Lagoon. At times it almost feels like a red herring in its own film, such is the focus on the nefarious Joe. With a lesser actor this wouldn't have worked at all, but Richard Ruxton brings a tour de force to the table, with a perpetual scowl plastered on his face and twitchy, violently irate demeanour he blows gusts of derangement through his every moment of screen time, a remarkable gonzoid villain. Don Leifert is slightly lower key but nonetheless palpably loathsome as Frank, while various Dohler relatives and local types bulk out the cast. There are a few shootings, cool shonky mini explosion effects and powerful spurts of tension, this undoubtedly aided by driving synths from Norman Noplock (sadly this is his only credit), like I said up top this one is committed and so when it strikes, it strikes hard. Things move at a smart clip and the short runtime feels like a breeze, by the time the ending locks in it's a breathless ride and the ending itself is a terrific capper. Now I wouldn't possibly recommend this to ""regular"" cinema fans, but as a devotee of low budget science fiction lunacy I thought this a really great time. If you're still reading this, you might to. Check it out say I, 7/10.",positive

(This plot angle certifies the level of credibility we are dealing with) Brandon Lee sure made a lot of bad movies in his day. With the overrated Rapid Fire, the mediocre (though watchable)Showdown In Little Tokyo and of course this movie, one can only conclude that The Crow really was his best effort. (Actually his Hong Kong produced movie Legacy Of Rage is supposed to be pretty good. I ordered it, to review it) Anyway Laser Mission is easily the worst from Brandon Lee but that's not to say it isn't entertaining. It is in fact ultimately hilarious. When Laser Mission starts we witness men put gas-masks on while the credits role and the Laser Mission theme plays and we meet people at a party, when the guy explains the caliber of quality of the diamond, the crowd breaks out in hilarious whistling. The directing apparently implies that this was filmed with a hand-held camera (the cheapest type) and people are gassed all for a diamond which looks really fake. Brandon Lee then arrives talks to Ernest Borgnine, gets shot with a dart and then wakes up in prison. He fights his way out and these action sequences are truly stilted. Worst of all is the acting from Debi Monahan (The Seinfeld chick who got killed, right?) Her high pitched squealing along with Lee's overly smug presence (Seriously Brandon Lee was an appealing actor, but not here) make for the funniest moments. Brandon Lee also dresses up as a Cuban, we see two Cuban soldiers who are movie's would be comic relief make the same jokes over and over again. The funniest part of the movie is the climax where we see Brandon Lee get shot at by the main bad guy but then run him over with the car. However when he gets shot at, he's standing outside the car, the next shot is edited of the car charging towards him. Hilarious. More unintentional hilarity ensues but hey this movie was only 2.99 and if you're a big time Brandon Lee fan, or a fan of camp this is perfect cheese.  * out of 4-(Bad)",negative
47,0-tt0099978,Laser Mission,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099978/,Where is this happening ???,"Michael Gold (Brandon Lee) is a mercenary hired by the CIA to find a German scientist (Ernest Borgnine). The scientist has developed a laser technology that everyone wants. After their rendezvous on the beach, both Brandon and Borgnine are captured. This sets up the daring escape by Brandon, after which he volunteers to go back and find the professor.  This movie is classically bad. It seems to take place in Africa, with Soviet, Cuban and German soldiers involved. Debi Monahan rounds up the cast as the professor's daughter. She is thoroughly annoying in this role, as her voice seems to increase in pitch as she gets louder and is also very whiny. The only redeeming qualities of her character is her push up blue dress, which seems to be the only thing she wears during the movie (she does wear a white jump suit at the beginning and a bed sheet after the ""sex"" scene).  Brandon Lee is suppose to be the star of this movie, however, he comes off quite flat. Its not just the acting thats bad but also the action. I haven't seen so many drop-kicks since Star Trek : The Original Series. He also tries to emulate his father by doing ""characterizations"" (see Chinese Connection). The slapping Manuel sketch is a good indicator how bad his acting is. It is funny though. He also seems to pull off an Arab beggar.  To complement Brandon (other than Debi Monahan), we get Mr. Borgnine (whom we see actually sleeping during a scene), a crazy Soviet Colonel (who refuses to die), a white big game hunter and a pair of bungling Cuban soldiers (a female Sergeant and the beloved Manuel).  Nothing sums up this movie more completely than the ""theme song"" of the movie (Mercenary Man), which seems to be playing in either muzak form or the 80's bad rock form and the dialog.  Dialog such as :   (Brandon) I did my job. Pay me and let me get the hell outta here.  (CIA suit) Kiss ... my ... ass !!!   (Brandon) NO !  This movie was definitely worth the $4 I spent on it.

48,16-tt0052077,Plan 9 from Outer Space,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052077/,The Worst Film of All TIme - Plan 9 From Outer Space,"This film is so bad, that it is good. My son Joe and I have seldom laughed so often during a film; even the best comedies from Hollywood. There are so many unintentionally hilarious scenes, that one hardly knows where to begin. Let's start with Lugosi. Somehow, he does not look like your typical Long Island houseowner; his European cape is strangely not in sync with the rest of the community. The gravedigger scene is very funny as well. How cheap are the people in this community with their loved one's graves? A cheap wooden cross instead of a headstone? That is pretty cheap; but not as cheap as the sets in this film. Ed Wood, bless his soul, does a masterful job of ruining every scene with horrendous props. I love the curtains separating the pilots of an airliner from the passengers that we never see. Great security. Remind me not to travel on that airline. But this is not the only place with curtains. The pilot's home (even though he lives outside with his wife) has curtains outside the home. I have never seen this decor before. Even the spaceship has curtains. The people who made curtains as props for this film made a fortune.  I think that The Price is Right must have the director's favorite TV show. (What's behind curtain number two?). The cast had two major problems; very few of them knew how to drive a car. Two of them put the cars in reverse before driving. Two others leave the lights after leaving the car. Another problem area for both the police and the aliens are their weapons. They don't seem to work. The aliens are forced to flee when their microwave oven catches fire. This is perfectly understandable. There is also a very fat man who wanders around looking for food and a scantily-dressed woman who doesnt change her clothes for four days and can be smelled from over 100 yards away. This film is not half-baked; it not even in the oven. But it very funny to watch.",positive

And, still, we laugh and look forward to each scene because we know what's next. We know that Bela passed away and a guy who has no physical resemblance to him had to take over. There is no real plot. I believe that the worst list is for movies that have no heart--something like ""Godzilla vs. Freddy Mercury.""

52,3-tt0094271,Violent Shit,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094271/,"It's Violent alright, but it's also a steaming pile of...","What should I have expected from a movie that says, 'Experience a lesson in real BAD taste' and 'Expect the worst' on the front cover? Starring an actor called K. the butcher shitter and produced by the violent shitters? This was the debut of loud-mouthed German gore fiend Andreas Schnaaaaas. (!) A director that's renowned for releasing 'films' that would get banned in most countries for their titles alone. Shot on a camcorder, Violent Shit makes Nail Gun Massacre look like Spielberg helmed it in his spare time under a pseudonym. Seriously, this isn't a movie at all; it's more like an exercise in restraint. Sitting through the whole eighty minutes is like being locked in a room with Peewee Herman and not killing him. A task that, if completed, will prove a man's machismo so decidedly, that he will be able to walk proud for the rest of his life. If you've checked my review list, you'll see that I'm a forgiving fellow. I'd have to be, because I've seen some utter schlock in my life, but this wipes the existence of the worst of them from my memory. Quite how it went on to spawn three sequels is amazing, and how the crew behind the production was not imprisoned for some kind of breach of human rights was a further miracle. Still, I've started my review so I may as well tell you what left me so bemused.  The credits roll over a child playing in some woodland with a ball. He goes home and his mother threatens him, saying `You wait.Get in here' The door closes and we hear a somewhat leisurely scream. It looks as if the youngster killed his mum with a meat cleaver, because he comes outside splashed in blood with the weapon in his hand. Two decades later, the Police (or Polizei) are transferring the demented looking bogeyman to, erm. well, we don't ever learn; but thankfully an officer sums it up neatly for us. `Now we have to work overtime to bring these retards back to their holes!' I couldn't have put it better myself. I must comment on the security, which was questionable to say the least. I mean, is that how they transfer homicidal maniacs in Germany? In an Herby-esque camper van without any bars on the windows or dead locks on the door? Hmmm. Anyway, one of the coppers makes the fatal mistake of giving in to the call of nature and returns to find his buddies bloodily despatched surprisingly off screen. I thought the killer (we don't find out his name) was giving one of them a love bite, but I guess he was eating his neck! After shouting, `Stop you pig, or I'll shoot' (!) the final lawman meets his bloody end by a patently cardboard machete to the shoulder. His demise was undoubtedly his own fault for leaving such a deadly blade inside the van with a nut-job in the first place, but hey, I guess his rampage had to be kicked off somehow. Without going into the fact that this constabulary's methods for transferring psychopaths certainly needed a complete overhaul, let's just say that the butcher ends up roaming the countryside and killing everyone that he bumps into on his journey.  The plot's is as non-existent as anyone could expect it to be, he legs it around some Greenland, with a blade in his hand and a scar on his cheek(s) offing anyone that bumps into him. The first, a woman driving along listening to UB40's 'Red Red Wine' (has Schnaas been sued or did he buy the rites? - I very much doubt it!) breaks down, then gets thrown on the floor and her breast cut off. After some bizarre camera work involving the photographer spinning the camcorder in circles (yes, you'll get a headache!) a guy gets his penis chopped in half! All these are shot in unflinching close-up with paint-red blood spraying unconvincingly over the surroundings. Then an unfortunate vulgar speeched gardener gets cut in half with a hedge trimmer then his head is chopped in two! The final excuse for gratuitous gore that I'll tell you about (although there's plenty more throughout the eighty minute runtime), involves a woman getting split in half from the vagina upward. Then the killer (we still didn't learn his name) disembowels her, chucking her intestines, liver and every other organ that Schnaas could find a close replica for, - on the floor in front of the camera! I'm making this sound a whole lot better than it actually is, but keep in mind that the 'acting' is no less than ridiculous, the music is played separately from the (German - subtitled in English) dialogue (what do you expect from a camcorder) and the lighting stinks. At one-point things got all anti-religious when the nut-job sticks his head in, I guess what's supposed to be Jesus' stomach! We don't get an explanation on why there he is - the Son of God - stuck on a crucifix out in the middle of the woods! And the ending, oh yes the ending. What the hell?  There's loads of pointless padding, like endless driving sequences showing cars heading down long, boring roads that never amount to anything and there's some X-rated dialogue that brings about a giggle. I guess we can forgive some of the inconsistencies, seeing how this was made tongue in cheek to be consumed in the same manor, but to be honest, a lot of the pointless exploitation was a little too sickening and not in a good way. Schnaas really should have started himself a career in special effects, putting his clearly visible talents to use with more experienced filmmakers. But instead he goes on to make movies like this that will only appeal to gore hounds that are truly forgiving. What's left to say about Violent Shit? Is it Violent? Yes, very.

Of course, with that title this film is irresistible, but it's also rather dull. Horror fans hoping for werewolf action will be disappointed to learn that the werewolf scenes are limited to a couple of brief fights and murders with characters wearing what look like reject masks from an old Lon Chaney movie.  For much of the running time this is a straightforward biker flick, padded out with some very bad acting and lots scenes of bikers riding down an empty highway in the blazing sunshine while music blares on the soundtrack.

A little Gem!","First off, ""Messalina, Empress of Rome"", is not the original title of this movie, and neither is ""Caligula, the sins of Rome"". These are both titles given to the original 1977 movie, ""Messalina! Messalina!"". It was re-titled for the video market in 1991 and 1994. The very cool thing about this movie is that it features almost all the sets and props used in the 1980 Classic, ""Caligula"". Caligula was actually shot in 1976, but because of various lawsuits, wasn't released until February 1980. The Co-Producer of Caligula, Franco Rossellini, decided in early 1977 to use the sets and props left-over from Caligula and shoot a quickie. He cast 2 actresses from Caligula, Anneka di Lorenzo and Lori Wagner, for the new movie, and then brought in a whole new crew to help out. It's true this movie isn't the best, it's dubbed from the Italian, it's grainy, but it is definatley a fun watch. There are some very funny scenes, some nice boobies, and a bit of a story to keep things interesting.

""Messalina, Messalina"" is not exception from the norm, with the exception, that the film contains more nudity. Lots and lots of nudity and, the film being all about the Empress Messalina cheating on her husband, Emperor Claudius (the successor of Emperor Caligula, so don't be fooled by the alternative title ""Caligula 2""), some of the sex-scenes, depending on the copy you own, trespassing from soft- to hardcore.  Among the most popular spaghetti-comedies, were those featuring Bud Spencer and Terence Hill – the Italian version of Laurel and Hardy, if you so want. There's no Spencer and no Hill in this film (both, presumably, having fought tooth and nail against appearing in a film like ""Messalina, Messalina""). Instead, we get Thomas Milan and Bombolo. Both go through the routine, but it's never more than that: routine.  In addition to the gratious nudity, the film features a battle-scene, which has enough gore and limb-hacking to rival the violence of ""Gladiator"". Interesting trivia: much of the set and costumes (not to mention some of the actors like Lori Wagner and Anneka Di Lorenzo) have been borrowed from the set of Bob Guccione's ""Caligula"", so for fans of this notorious epic, the film remains worthwhile curiosity with an eerie sense of Deja-Vu.

A bunch of serious Martian adults are afraid that their serious Martian children are too serious, so they go to a serious Martian senior citizen. The old guy tells them that the children need to be taught how to laugh, and then he explodes for no reason. The only logical thing left to do, of course, is go to Earth and kidnap Santa Claus, who we meet as he is being interviewed by the Rip Taylor-like Andy Anderson. I liked how in the movie's universe, Santa is unquestionably real and everyone knows about him. He really does deliver toys to everyone, toys made by a dozen elves (who all look like they're suffering from mini-seasonal depression). One toy shown is a toy rocket that runs on ""real rocket fuel"", Santa proudly explains. I would ask, ""Where do little kids get rocket fuel?"" The details of Santa's amazingly speedy mass distribution methods are not brought up, but it's probably black magic-related.  The Martians nab Kris Kringle and two little Earth children, who seem to live alone in the woods with no parents or family but are clean and well fed. The Martian leader forces Santa and the children to run their soulless toy machine (Soulless Toy Machine would be a good name for a band). Despite the numerous violations of human rights, it's all in good fun and everybody is nice and happy, except for one mean Martian (with a disturbing droopy mustache and a sidekick that looks like Jamie Farr) who plots to kidnap Santa (even though he's already been kidnapped). Santa encourages the kids, even the Martian kids who have now learned to have fun, to hurl lots of heavy mid-sixties toys at the bad guy's skulls. Through this display of parental negligence and bad music the evil is thwarted, and Santa is permitted to go back to Earth, letting the mewling half-wit comic relief Martian named Droppo take over the reigns of the Martian Toy Empire. (The Martians are out-of-shape guys in tights and helmets with antenna sprouting out of them, and what looks like diarrhea smeared across their faces. Imagine a guy dressed like that mugging worse than the teacher guy in Juan Piquor Simon's ""Monster Island"" and that's Droppo).  How can you hate this movie? If I were a little kid in 1964 I'd be enthralled. They packed this movie with nutty stuff. Elves get shot with freeze rays. Mrs. Claus is a frantic goofball. The Martian children sleep under strange lights and eat only pills. The bad guy's hideout looks like that one King Crimson album cover.  I loved the part where the villain tries to shoot Santa and the kids out of an airlock, and the part where the bad guys meddle with the toy machine and the toys come out all mixed-up. There's a guy in a goofy robot costume, and a guy in an even goofier polar bear costume. And that deliciously idiotic theme song- ""You spell it S-A-N-T-A C-L-A-U-S, Hooray for Santy Claus!"" Oh, it's so good!  I sincerely feel the people making this had the best intentions, and while they didn't have a huge budget they made a fun, silly kids movie. If it was the same exact movie but done in Rudolf-style stop motion animation it would be a regular holiday viewing tradition.  Oh, yeah, and  Pia Zadora is in this, as if anyone cares.",positive

John Travolta is out of his head and hopelessly devoted to L. Ron Hubbard. That he was able to con 10 other people into investing $80 million towards the making of this movie is the only real impressive angle I can work for this review. Perhaps Travolta wanted to work with Tarrantino again and thought the only way that that could happen is if his own career fell into the tank? Or perhaps he felt it was his duty to make the film in order to get a better seat in 'Dianetics Heaven'? Let's hope that Tom Cruise can learn from Barbarino's mistake.   I don't think it will matter too much to point out everything that is bad about this film, but the acting, the dialog, the special effects, the plausibility of the cave people's quick learning development, and of course, the hair extensions will just have to suffice.  I would have given the movie a 1 out 10 rating, but I did laugh at the movie quite a few times and that should be worth something, I think. The version I watched was on the USA network and it was modified for teevee, so I may have missed some key plot elements that were cut from the original vision of its director, but then again I may have seen some really good Levitra adds in its place.

67,15-tt0185183,Battlefield Earth,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185183/,Things I learned while watching BATTLEFIELD EARTH...,"...not because Travolta is in dreds, not because of the alleged scientology subliminal messages, but because it is one of the worst movies ever made.   
I do not use that term lightly.  I consider myself a lover of bad movies, movies that can be enjoyed for their lack of success.  ""Battlefield Earth"" goes well beyond that into the realm of slow torturous pain.  I saw this movie because I expected it to be bad, and even I was shocked at how bad it was.  Just plain bad.  In nearly every respect.  I suppose I should note that the ear-bleeding sound effects sounded pretty realistic.  And they were loud.  So the guy who did the sound shouldn't be ashamed.  Everyone else that worked on this movie, bow your heads.  Director Roger Christian has put together one of the worst movies sci-fi or otherwise that I have seen.  Loaded with uninteresting characters, a dumb plot, ridiculous gaping holes in logic, terrible direction, only so-so special effects, and a huge length for a movie this bad (over two hours), ""Battlefield Earth"" is already being compared to ""Plan 9 From Outer Space."" In my book, it's a fair comparison.  Take the direction.  Sure Ed Wood had no clue what he was doing, but at least he pointed the camera directly at the actors when they talked. Christian decides he's going to be original and tilt the camera at least 45 degrees everytime someone says anything.  The whole movie I was tilting my head side to side, trying to keep up.  The effects, well ""Plan 9"" had pie tins in strings.  ""Battlefield Earth"" has a couple of nifty CGI effects, but the final length battle sequence is filmed in a very dark blue setting, rendering it impossible to see who is shooting who at any given moment.  Of course, even if I had known it wouldn't have made much of a difference because I really didn't care about any of the characters one way or another.  Gaping continuity?  Well, ""Plan 9"" had scenes in cars that began in the day, then turned to night when people got out of the cars.  In ""Battlefield Earth"", the Psychlos can discover gold veins in difficult to reach mountains, but somehow totally miss out on Fort Knox, still completely stocked with gold 1,000 years in the future.  Cavemen learn not only to speak and work together, but operate Harrier jets within a week.  How did they learn you ask?  Well on a Harrier jet flight simulator of course, somehow still working on electricity 1,000 years in the future.  More?  The cavemen communicate with walkie-talkies in the final battle.  How do they still work?  They found fresh batteries?  Next Duracels I see, they better say ""Best if used before 3005.""  Is ""Battlefield Earth"" worse than ""Plan 9""?  I'd have to say yes.  ""Plan 9"" is so cheesy and goofy you have to laugh.  Just fun to watch.  After about an hour of ""Earth"" I wanted to hurt someone.  After two hours and it was still going, I wanted to hurt myself.

On concept this high brow yet simple movie of mockery is a thing of genius. I mean make a movie about a guy named Alen Smithee whom is losing control of a big budget movie. However, he cannot disavow the movie because he is the ""fake name"" he is Alen Smithee. Now thats funny (but maybe only if you know movie history?) Perhaps it is to high brow because nobody went to see this film. OR perhaps it is to English (ie Eric Idle as the leading role). Or perhaps it is just plan terrible.  The movie basically, rather than poking fun at Hollywood and the stream of never ending big budget special effect extravaganzas (which Eric Idle's character is making 1 of), pokes fun at itself instead. It jokes about the movie being made is worse than Showgirls (BHB is from the writer of Showgirls), but in reality the movie (BHB) itself is worse than Showgirls.  The actors just don't have any fun and are not very good.  They are stuck in the middle of hamming it up and actually acting.  This is probably because the fake movie is supposed to be bad, but instead that badness overflows into the real movie.  Jackie Chan, Sly Stallone, and Whoppie Goldberg cameo as overpaid and past their prime actors demanding huge wages and silly concessions and while some aspects are true, they don't all apply to the actors (Jackie Chan wanting like red M&ms taken out or something?) Anyway, the movie turned out to be directed by Alan Smithee which is almost a saving grace, but it had to be the writers cut which survived to get that moniker and not the directors cut.

Enjoyability of the movie [10/10]  Total paradox, right?  This is the absolute pinnacle of bad story, bad dialogue, bad editing, bad plot.. I mean, I'm saying 'bad' like there actually is any of these elements within the film. The editing makes no sense, it seems randomly cut with continuity errors, there are lines like 'What's going on with the candles and the music' when there ARE NO candles or music.. The entire thing is absurd. But what makes it truly unique is that it was done entirely seriously, this is not a tongue in cheek production like low budget bad movies that know they are catering to an audience who expect to laugh at the poor effects and story.. No, this man, Tommy Wuseau, honestly, genuinely thought he was crafting his magnum opus, masterpiece of cinema.  Is it good? Absolutely, definitely not.  However - as a movie EXPERIENCE. I watched this with some of my family, warning them it was terrible, but we had one of the funniest, most incredible bonding experiences in cinematic history - As we collectively picked apart every camera angle, wobbly set, insane use of props, costume, music that skips, repeats, continuity, edits, plot and dialogue. There is not one redeeming moment in the entire movie. Even if there is a single well crafted line (there isn't) it would have to be spoken by either a terrible actor or by Tommy himself, who's accent sounds like it was in a European car crash . We all laughed until it HURT, and for that.. I have to give the experience a 10/10. I've never enjoyed a movie more with friends and family more than this one.. EVER.  I head that the experience is similar in theatres that still show this film for precisely this reason. Everybody dresses up as their favourite character, recites every line and throws spoons at the screen every time one inexplicably ends up on screen (it's a lot.. is there a reason behind this 'artistic' decision. No. There is no reason for anything)  There is more and more to notice about this film every time I watch it.. Most recently, how the architecture of the building makes no sense whatsoever. They appear to be on the ground floor, but exiting from the other side causes them to end up on the roof - at night. It's things like this that could inspire a PhD in studying the intricate insanity and entirely non sequitur values of every moment in The Room.  Do I recommend it? Well.. how can I not. Everyone needs to see this movie at least once, after a couple of drinks and with friends. It's even funnier than Weekend at Bernies after taking magic mushrooms.

The film was obviously shot on a really low budget and without any real actors. It has a kind of ""Manos"" feel to it, but with nudity and even worse special effects. There are bats that are obviously on wires and some pretty cheesy costumes. The guy doing Dracula's voice sounds like an old Jewish man (I don't know where the hell they got the idea to make Dracula Jewish, considering he was Transylvanian). The only thing that I liked about this movie is that it didn't take itself seriously at all.  Count Dracula is living in an abandoned mine in the middle of nowhere. He invites a local reporter to visit him (he goes under the pseudonym of Alucard, hee hee hee, like nobody's ever heard that before). When the inept reporter gets there, Dracula turns him into a pretty crappy looking wolf man, named Irving Jackelmann (enough with the Jewish jokes already). Dracula then sends him out to catch beautiful girls for him to tie up, love up and drain dry. Dracula takes a hankering for the reporter's girl friend and ends up chasing her around his cave.  The opening ten minutes have some really awful stream of consciousness speech by the reporter involving the blue mountains, behind the blue mountains, behind the blue mountains (we get it already). Dracula's accent is just plain annoying. Irving Jackelmann also proves to be pretty bad. The chase scene, for the love of God, was only a nude woman running around the same set for an excruciatingly long time. The nudity can't save it and the jokes, although trying hard to be campy, are just plain dumb.  Avoid unless you can spare a few brain cells.",positive

Either way, the words they chose to use as the script are almost like they didn't know the original story and were making it up as it went along. Telling jokes the whole time and making funny comments about everything that you wouldn't normally hear a character in a movie say. They cut on each other and talk about how they have to go to the bathroom and juvenile things like that. I doubt it translated much at all from the original.  After the funny parts at the beginning (like the opening monologue about the blue mountains), the movie goes downhill and becomes monotonous. It's like soft core. But it's sort of rude! Dracula gets these women naked and then insults them because they have small breasts or are too heavy or something. Usually you have a naked woman on the screen and everyone is excited. But Dracula is very snooty and picky! It's sort of funny, but also sort of mean. Especially since I don't think he was supposed to say those things originally.

Harrison has honed his martial arts skills to perfection for this  film and it has paid off in spades. He's great with a blowpipe and  his teleportation skills just get better and better. i only have two complaints with this film.  Firstly: It's quite hard to see Harrison in his Ninja attire due to the  fact it's camoflage material and often Harrison vanishes into the  background. Especially during scenes filmed in a park.  Secondly: I couldn't watch the end because it concentrated on  Warren's relationship with his brother David. David's not a  handsome chap and seeing him do the nasty with a random  wench made my eyes bleed.  Overall though i'd give it 9/10.

The female mage has nothing to do but to look nice and to scream in moments of danger. She hardly ever uses her magic abilities, and therefore is a splendid example of the poor role play adaption this movie is. She is no mage - she is simply a damsel in distress.  The humor of the movie also is very simple and nothing to really laugh about. That is, if you leave out Jeremy Irons' incredibly bad acting - his bad mage routine should be added to acting books under the chapter ""how to overplay a character"". But, to be true, those were the most funny moments of the movie, so at least Irons was good for something here...

Truth was, the management was tickled pink by our childish fears and antics. The movie itself proved nonsensical, poorly made, Juvenal, Shylock, half baked and phony in every respects. Still for 1957 it was the stuff of frighting childhood dreams and we were of that age. As an adult, I am amused at what I considered frightening and snicker at sci-fi scenes from B-Picture actor like Jeff Morrow, Dabbs Greer and what the character's called a nightmare chicken.

What's more, the film even manages to drum up some sympathy for its protagonist who is ostracised by his colleagues and who does everything possible to satisfy his girlfriend's interests (one gets the sense that she was always more into it than him). Unfortunately, the film falls apart around halfway through as his girlfriend walks out, leading to him quite literally meandering around. He cries in the bathtub, goes to watch a horror movie that is not nearly nasty enough for him, and the list goes on as he wallows in depression. And yet, while the fact that the story comes to a virtual halt in the second half is perplexing, it is arguably the less shocking nature of the majority of the second half that underwhelms the most. The extent of the young couple's deviancy is the real highlight here, particularly with all the intriguing questions of what led to them to have such a perverse interest in corpses. The graphic scenes of the protagonist and his work colleagues cleaning corpses up is pretty intense too.

As luck would have it, one day he comes across a rather well preserved corpse ('rather well' as in it's a rotted, blue hunk of tissue) while on duty. He manages to sneak the body home, much to the delight of his lady-friend, and they go about having their dirty little way with it. It soon becomes clear that the girl is enjoying the company of the corpse more than her still breathing boyfriend and runs off with it. Needless to say, this does nothing healthy for his already deranged mental state (being dumped for another guy is bad, being dumped for a dead one is even worse).  Believe it or not, watching them have sex with the gooey body is NOT the nastiest thing you'll see here. All manners of assorted atrocities are committed for your viewing un-pleasure, most all of them rank in the 'so sick you can hardly watch' category. I will not spoil the best of them, just rest assured that gore-hounds will most certainly be pleased (if not disgusted).  For better or worse, the film is not very competently made. The corpse and gore effects are very good, but the film stock and technique are both pretty sub-standard. And with the script being so barren and the acting merely passable, the shock moments are all that will keep hardened viewers watching 'till the gruesome conclusion.  If you are looking for good story telling, look else where. If you're looking for a good sex flick, look else where. If you are looking for the ultimate stomach churner, you've found it.  6/10",positive
88,14-tt0067148,Godzilla vs. Hedorah,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067148/,Craziest movie ever!,"Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster is the kind of movie that doesn't know what kind of movie it wants to be. It must be a kid's movie, because the protagonist is an annoying kid who idolizes Godzilla. Yet some scenes would be more at home in a horror film; as when crowds of people are asphyxiated and skeletonized by the smog monster's noxious emissions. At other times there are signs that this movie wants to be a drug fueled exploitation flick. There are weird cartoon sequences that seem inspired by Yellow Submarine, and at one point a character in a dance club starts hallucinating, for no apparent reason, that his fellow party-goers have paper Mache fish for heads.   There's also a perfunctory astronomy lesson with no real connection to the rest of the film, plus a shot where Hedorah, the titular Smog Monster, flies through a construction site, and the structure collapses, but with no sound. Was the recording track for scene damaged at some point? If that were the case, you would think the filmmakers could re-record the sound effects, or substitute a clip from the studio's library.  But I'm forgetting what this movie is all about, which is Godzilla- and the need to protect the environment. In 1971, when the film was released, this message had not yet become a cliché in children's movies. It was also a very relevant at a time when there was little to no regulation of factory emissions and hazardous waste disposal, and when rivers in downtown Cleveland could suddenly burst into flames.  But Godzilla makes a very odd environmental spokesman, to say the very least. When he first appeared in 1954's Gojira, he was the embodiment of the death and destruction that nuclear weapons could, and had, unleashed on Japan and on the world. Now however, he is Tokyo's savior, a completely benign figure who doesn't knock over a single building, even by accident. Godzilla doesn't always have to play the villain, but he should at least be an anti-hero, dangerous to man even when he's protecting us from other monsters.   Godzilla also makes one of his least dramatic entrances in this film. Instead of slowly rising from the sea, or bursting out of an iceberg, he ambles out of the sunrise as annoying trumpet music blares. Regrettably, this score will be repeated in most scenes where the big guy appears.   As for Godzilla's opponent, Toho has come up with one of its cooler ideas here. Hedorah is not a single organism, but rather colony of billions of rapidly splitting microorganisms. This means that it can change form at will, and can repair almost any damage suffered by producing new cells. Unfortunately, the idea just didn't work. What we end up with, at least in the monster's final form, is a giant, misshapen blob of rubber under which the actor can barely move.   This brings us to the battles between the monsters, usually the high point of any Godzilla film. Some of the earlier fights aren't too badly staged, but once Hedorah learns to fly, Godzilla's main tactic seems to be standing around and failing his arms angrily. And as for the final battle near Mount Fuji, having the military build a pair of giant electrodes to dehydrate the Smog Monster is a fairly good idea, since by this point it's clear that Godzilla can't do it on his own.  But why oh why did this have to mean a protracted sequence in which our hero rips apart his now helpless opponent piece by piece (twice!), to make sure that every drop of moisture is evaporated? Wouldn't it have been more effective for Hedorah to instantly dry out and crumble to dust, like a vampire exposed to sunlight? This isn't Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster, it's Godzilla vs. the giant mud pie.  There's also the question of how Godzilla knew the purpose and operation of the electrodes, and why his atomic breath provided power to them, rather than blasting them to bits like everything else it touches. But this isn't where our suspension of disbelief is really tested.   I mentioned earlier that Godzilla had to go through the process of drying out Hedorah twice. This is because the first time, there proves to some life still left in the blob of filth, and its prior flying form escapes into the sky. So how does Godzilla catch up to his rival and bring him back? Simple, he flies after him. That's right; Godzilla actually flies by using his atomic breath as a form of jet propulsion. This may be the single most ridiculous sequence in the history of Japanese cinema.  I'm not recommending that no one ever see this movie. It achieves a sort of campy grandeur, almost to the point of being so bad that it's good. I would suggest viewing this film just once, so you can gawk in amazement at its sheer awfulness. Or, if that's too much for you, just type in ""Godzilla flies"" on YouTube. You won't be disappointed by the result.",negative

Better known as Godzilla vs The Smog Monster, this flick tries to take on a different format that resembles a poor man's James Bond movie. Seems to be put together kind of haphazardly, but really pretty interesting. Godzilla battles Hedrah or Hedora, a creature spawned from industrial pollution and rank waste material. Probably the strangest in the Godzilla series.",negative

Tony Curtis as a dashing fortune-teller and huckster, prancing around his San Francisco bachelor pad wearing a sorcerer's outfit... one of his elderly female clients being possessed by an Indian spirit and being tossed down a flight of stairs... (you don't even need the pause button to see that the stunt ""double"" going down the stairs is a big dude in a dress and wig!!)... Burgess Meredith muddling through one of his last film roles, playing a senile old coot with amazing realism, to no one's surprise... an Indian shaman with a Yiddish-sounding New York City accent and a penchant for stale one-liners... a naked midget dressed up like an evil reincarnated Indian fetus covered with goo... a topless Susan Strassberg hovering in the fourth dimension and firing lightning bolts at the evil spirit using electrical energy from a huge 70's-model computer...

91,9-tt0077904,The Manitou,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077904/,A cheesy treat,"I found The Manitou to be quite an interesting, if not cheesy film. It starts off quite well and the pace moves along nicely as the story draws you in. The first half is dedicated to the story and what happens before the demon is born. The second half deals with what occurs after he is born and climaxes with a cheesy sci-fi ending. The acting is very solid throughout and the characters believable. The highlight of the film is supposedly when the demon is born, as he breaks out of the ""fetus"" attached to the woman's back. I didn't find it particularly impressive though. I did however enjoy the story about the Indian spirit and how this would be his fourth or fifth incarnation. I've always had a soft spot for mythology and ""demon births"", probably from watching too many Xena: Warrior Princess episodes.   The film is spoilt mainly by the ultra cheesy ending, that looks like something out of an old Star Trek episode. Up until that point I thought the story worked well as a serious film, but the ending brought it into cheese territory and ruined it for me. It's not that I don't like cheese, but you can't just introduce it in the last 10 minutes of a film and get away with it!",positive
92,2-tt0070122,Godzilla vs. Megalon,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070122/,Another Alien-Invasion Plot!,"This is the funniest single entry into the Godzilla series. It is so incredibly bad, that there is not a single scene that doesn't have at least a chuckle or two; and many that have slap-your-knee hilarity to them - all unintentional.  The director, Jun Fukoda, was no stranger to the Godzilla series, and had already demonstrated that he could deliver a solidly competent B-movie. But this ain't one of those; and it's hard to say where Fukoda's head was at when he made this film.  We see actors miss their cues; we see strings lifting ""flying"" monsters; we have a robot with an idiotic smile painted on his face; we have a theme song popping up at the end that is only a parody of a pop-music movie theme. We have an annoying little kid actor that can't act. We have a cheesy giant cock-roach rubber suit flopping about crushing buildings, and then running from Godzilla with the gate of an old woman. We have the magic words that bring Megalon to life: ""Rise up Megalon! Hey, get up!"" while nymphettes do a veil dance. we have a background music that sounds like easy listening played at twice the tempo. Obvious stock footage from previous Godzilla films get inter-cut in the fight scenes. We have a special guest appearance from Gigan, called in (no showing or explanation how) from a galaxy called ""Space Hunter M"" Now, what wit could actually come up with that as the name of galaxy? Really, you must see this film at least once in your life; and if you don't see the humor in it that one time, see it again, because it will dawn on you like the blast of a heat-ray that, yeah, this film really does make NO sense whatsoever! Obviously made in two days by a group of brainy grammar-school students who happen to be drunk. One couldn't make a parody of the Godzilla films as funny as this; yet, incredibly, there's no sign that this was not intended to be taken seriously.  But we don't have to take it seriously just because it was intended that way. And taken as a comedy, it's just grand!",negative
93,13-tt0070122,Godzilla vs. Megalon,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070122/,Toho's last throwaway entry of the 70s,"As a kid I used to enjoy this particular Godzilla film as it featured two foes for Godzilla and a robot to aid Godzilla. As I look back on it, I am not as fond of it. For one, there is just a lot of footage from other Godzilla films, mainly Godzilla versus Gigan. For another, it is just kind of weird and not in the Godzilla versus Hedorah good way either. At the same time I don't really count it as the low point of the Showa era either as I give that award to the Godzilla film titled Godzilla's Revenge in the United States. Granted, I would assume it goes by another name in Japan as Godzilla does not get any revenge in the film. There were other Godzilla films I liked less than this one, but this is the one I am reviewing today. This one also is one of two Godzilla films to get the MST3K treatment. The other being Godzilla versus the Sea Monster, which I find to be a good entry into the Godzilla series during its initial run.  The story has nuclear testing affecting things quite adversely as Monster Island where Godzilla resides is exploding and stuff right at the beginning. Also affected is a place known as Seatopia which is an underwater kingdom like Atlantis. They have had enough and unleash their monster, Megalon, to bring the world to its knees. For some reason they also need an inventor's robot as the monster Megalon needs to follow something in order to stay focused. The inventor, along with a kid who is either his brother or son and a dude who is like an action type guy must get Jet Jaguar out of the clutches of the Seatopians and use it to get Godzilla to fight off the terrible Megalon! If that were not bad enough, the space cockroaches who were clearly beaten in the last movie for reasons unknown agree to work with the Seatopians and lend out their monster Gigan!   This film made for a very funny episode of MST3K as there is just so much strange stuff going on! Seriously, why the heck did they show people go up and down the steps of that one house so many times? There is also the fact air conditioners are hung in said house and the whole strange living arrangement too. Perhaps, how they were related was explained more in the Japanese cut of this? I enjoyed the final fight as the gang started making it out to be a heavyweight fight!   So not the best Godzilla film, not by a long shot. Someone said it was better than Godzilla versus Gigan, but I preferred that one better as I liked the characters in that one better and the whole trying to uncover the identity of the strange duo running the Godzilla Tower. Here, we get the strange trio, but when I look at it know it reminds me of Johnny Quest as we have the inventor, the boy and the more athletic racing type. They just needed to add another kid and a dog. Jet Jaguar was apparently designed by a kid as they had a contest for kids to enter to design the robot, kind of surprised they went with one that is obviously just Ultraman with more colors. Still though, it still has a fond place in my heart because it did provide me with entertainment anytime I saw it as a child.",positive
94,9-tt0048696,Tarantula,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048696/,One of Universal's finest.,"One of countless 'big bug' features to come out of the U.S. during the 1950s, Jack Arnold's Tarantula is one of the most enjoyable of its kind. After Gordon Douglas' Them! really kicked off the fad in the previous year, Tarantula has everything audiences came to love about the genre; a dusty, middle-of-nowhere Arizona setting, the handsome yet charisma-free hero, the screeching love interest, the shady doctor who certainly knows far more than he is letting on, and, of course, the giant, 'terrifying' monster. What makes this film slightly more interesting than others of its ilk is the fact that it doesn't blame radiation on the deformed beast, but actually attempts to tell a story.  After renowned biological research scientist Eric Jacobs (Eddie Parker) is found dead in the desert, apparently suffering from a rapid form of acromegaly, Dr. Matt Hastings (John Agar) is called in from a nearby town to investigate. When Hastings suggests an autopsy to figure out what brought on such a rare disease and how it killed Jacobs so quickly, Dr. Gerald Deemer (Leo G. Carroll), one of Jacobs' colleagues, refuses his request and signs the death certificate himself. Back at Deemer's isolated desert research lab, it is revealed that the doctor has been experimenting on animals in a bid to save the future planet's food shortage, and has increased the size of a number of his subjects, including a tarantula. After a fire destroys Deemer's lab, the Arizona landscape is soon overshadowed by the giant, hungry arachnid.   While a radioactive isotope does crop up at one point, the 50 foot spider is purely the handiwork of a scientist with good intentions rather than government nuclear tests, and therefore Tarantula creates an interesting and conflicted character in Caroll's Deemer. Caroll certainly chews every scene, but proves a far more appealing male lead than the bland Agar. Yet the real star of Tarantula is the creature itself. The combination of matte effects and the use of a real spider, which would later be used on The Incredible Shrinking Man (1957) have aged spectacularly well, only failing to convince during the brief close-up shots of the last thing a few poor (and seemingly blind) souls see before they're gobbled up. While the climax is over before you know it, there's fun to be had in trying to spot a young and uncredited Clint Eastwood as a fighter pilot. It's no longer scary (was it ever?), but it has charm by the bucket load.",negative
95,15-tt0048696,Tarantula,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048696/,Prof. Deemer would have to work a LOT harder nowadays,"I've always wondered if director Jack Arnold could have raised higher should he have been able to work with big budget products and top stars casts. Arnold was a very smart filmmaker with a most direct and plain style that gave us such ""B"" classic films in different genres as ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon"" and ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" in the horror/sci-fi line, ""No name on the Bullet"" (Audie Murphy's best western no doubt) and even the fine comedy ""The Mouse That Roared"" (Peter Sellers was not a top star then). Who knows?   ""Tarantula"" is just another of Arnold's little ""B"" horror gems of the 50's, a most simple movie about insects turning huge to terrorize people, in this case the spider in the title. The film is interesting and enjoyable for fans of the genre (guilty!) and I remember it really scared me a lot when I saw it as a kid.  Though they would have never run for an Oscar John Agar, Mara Corday and Leo G. Carroll where very good in the main roles in a kind of film that was not about acting but about special effects and horrifying situations (just think for a second what it would be like to be chased by a hungry building size tarantula spider!).  All in all, ""Tarantula"" stands as a good piece in the ""B"" horror genre released by an intelligent director.",positive

Coming in at nearly 2 hours, you will feel every excruciating second of this lackluster film as you try to figure out why any of this ties into the original.

Until the last 15 minutes, there is nothing horrific, scary, or even unsettling. As a lover of films, and specifically a lover of bad films, this was nearly unwatchable and had me checking the time every few minutes in a fight to turn it off early.
