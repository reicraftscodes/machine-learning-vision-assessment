    "Now we will experiment with some different LSTM model architectures and hyperparameters but we will use [Comet ML](https://www.comet.com/site/) to log the training metrics and model hyperparameters. This will allow us to compare the impact of different models and different hyperparamters on the sentiment classification task. Comet allows you to track models, experiments and also produce graphs for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working in small groups of 2 to 4 to complete the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You will need a Comet ML account and ideally to have created a project. Once you have an account you will need your API key. A guide can be found [here](https://www.comet.com/docs/v2/guides/getting-started/quickstart/). You should be able to provide access to a Comet project for all members of the group, so that everyone can log experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The first two lines below create a comet experiment object that will be used to track the training and log metrics/parameters. You need the API key and to provide a project name. Then we can also provide a name for this experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Next some experiment and model hyperparameters are set within a dictionary. These can be any relevant values but for now we have one pre-processing parameter (`max_seq_len`), several model hyperparameters and some training parameters (`batch_size` and `epochs`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Build the model using the function you created in 1.3 (you can extend it if you wish), except use the parameters defined within the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Then, try experimenting with a few different architectures and hyperparameters to evaluate the impact on classification accuracy. Individually you could each explore the impact of different experiment parameters and then use Comet to compare results e.g. one person explores sequence lengths, another model hyperparameters, optimisers and learning rates and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Once you have a decent number of experiments/results (10 to 20 is fine) create a short report in Comet ML to present your findings. You can find a template to get you started [here](https://www.comet.com/nathanduran/imdb-sentiment-analysis/reports/hyperparameter-search). Make sure it includes some informative graphs/visualisations!\n",
