    "# Practical 1: Data Acquisition\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning algorithms require **a lot** of data, typically the more the better. Of course, there are many pre-existing datasets available and often used for learning purposes, or as benchmarks for particular NLP tasks, such as SQuAD and GLUE. These datasets are often well studied and can simply be downloaded and used with minimal pre-processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, applying NLP to a new problem or task will often require data to be gathered, processed and if ground-truth labels are needed (e.g. for supervised learning), annotated. Indeed, the process of data acquisition can often be one of the most time consuming and labour intensive of any NLP project. Depending on the problem the data could come from existing documents, created by hand, or we can use the largest source of information - the internet. [Web scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) allows us to extract data from websites, so it is possible to obtain huge amounts of information. In fact, scraping was used to extract the ~500 billion token datasets used to train some of the largest state-of-the-art (SOTA) language models, like GPT-3 ([Brown, T.B., et al., 2020](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/file/1457c0d6bfcb4967418bfb8ac142f64a-Paper.pdf)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practical we will use web scraping to gather some movie reviews written by IMDB users. Specifically, from [The Best Worst Movies](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls003589177/) list. Then, we will annotate these reviews with a sentiment, positive or negative. In later practicals we will learn how to process this data and then build a model to classify the sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objectives of this practical are:\n",
    "1. Understand the process of web scraping to obtain data\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use existing tools to annotate data and manage data versioning\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Consider the legal and ethical implications of web scraping and data acquisition in general\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Produce a set of IMDB user reviews, annotated with positive or negative sentiment"

However, in reality we may not know the exact URL, or we may wish to scrape many web pages at once. In this case we have a list of movies and we need to find the links to each of their IMDB pages. Unfortunately IMDB would prefer we use their API for retrieving data, so to simplify the process we will use a list of movies stored in CSV format. The following demonstrates how to scrape the first review of the first movie in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First we will load the .csv file containing the movie titles and their URL's.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Next we send a request for the first movies review page. The response is the same information used by your browser to render the page. If you uncomment `print(response.content)` you can see the full response (it's pretty horrible) and `print(response.status_code)` tells us if it returned correctly or if there was an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Then we use beautiful soup to parse the response into a more manageable object ('soup'). Again, if you uncomment `print(soup.prettify())` you can see what this looks like (better, but still horrible).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now we can begin to parse the page's data to find the reviews titles and contents. If you opened the page in your browser you can right click on a movie title and select 'inspect'. This will open the developer console and you should see that each review title is actually in an an `h3` tag (of class `ipc-title__text`) and the review body is held within a `div` tag (of class `ipc-html-content-inner-div`). So we can use bs4 to get a list of all the titles and review contents of these types.\n",

      "First review content: SUPERMAN IV: THE QUEST FOR PEACE  OK... so everyone knows that this is the worst Superman movie ever made... but if you have not seen it in a while, you should watch it.  It is still pretty rubbish, but it is not as bad as I remember.  The story is not that bad... Superman rids planet Earth of all the nuclear weapons, and in doing so unknowingly creates a super villain named Nuclear Man thanks to arch rival Lex Luthor.  The movie does star all the original cast, which surprised me. I knew Christopher Reeve was in it... and after reading his autobiography now know why. He said in the book that he only made it because the film studio wanted to make it and they said to him that they would only finance another movie he wanted to make if he made Superman IV. I will quote what he said in his book... \"The less said about Superman IV the better.\"  Gene Hackman returns as Lex Luthor & Margot Kidder is back as Lois Lane. They all did good jobs as always, although Margot was a bit unsure in places. The other supporting cast were not great. Mariel Hemingway played the new boss of the Daily Planet. She was awful... not a great actress in this I'm afraid. But she was not the worst. Mark Pillow played Nuclear Man. Absolutely terrible. His acting was definitely the worst of the whole quadrilogy.  The effects in this film were so bad. You could see that the budget of this film was so much less than the other 3 movies made. Superman flying was so bad that Flash Gordon was more convincing... and speaking of Flash Gordon... Nuclear Man looked like him... but more camp! Nuclear Mans outfit was embarrassing... it was not much of a super villains outfit. It honestly was just a bad character through and through.  There are also some really bad scenes... there was a scene where a large chuck of the Great Wall of China gets destroyed and Superman fixes it just by looking at it and using some dodgy blue eye lasers. What the hell? Terrible. Also, there is a scene where Nuclear Man kidnaps a Lacy and takes her into space... WHAT? He drags her to space and not only does she not scream or even say anything, but she can breathe fine in space... erm... really? I know Superman was never meant to be realistic, but that is too much!  When I was a kid I was a big fan of the Superman movies... but I think my parents protected me from this disappointment, because I don't remember this film at all... I didn't see this film until I was an adult. Haha. Thanks Mum.  I will give this film 5 out of 10.  It's a shame about this film... it was a very disappointing ending to Christopher Reeves Superman career. But no matter what he will always be a legend.
